title: Metamodel (Ecore) Design Checklist

tags: [ecore, eclipse, emf]

This is an index page for the *Metamodel (Ecore) Design Checklist* serie, a condensed version listing all the rules of the article ([part1](../ecore-design-checklist-part1) and [part2](../ecore-design-checklist-part2)) for your convenience.

I compiled the following checklist based on my personal experience, this is not exhaustive and I expect it to live and get richer over time.

> Most of the checks stated here are very easy to comply with when considered from the start. 
> When it's later down the road the gain/risk ratio should be evaluated as some changes might need to update some code, some files or might just be too much work to be worth it then. 
> Because of this and because we sometime learned the hard way you might quite easily find some Ecore models I authored which are not 100% compliant with this list ;).

By the way, feel free to [tell me about your own rules](https://twitter.com/bruncedric), I might add it to the list!
