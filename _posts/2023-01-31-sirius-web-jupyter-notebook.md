At the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.dev/) conference last October, we had the opportunity to demonstrate an integration of [Eclipse Sirius Web](https://www.eclipse.dev/sirius/sirius-web.html) and [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook for seamless design, simulation, and analysis.



As a data enthusiast, I've always been impressed by the versatility of Jupyter. It serves as a hub for reproducible science and a gateway to a vast array of Python 🐍frameworks for data science🔢 , visualization 📉, machine learning and much more.
Even if the demo is fairly basic I wanted to showcase how such integrations can remodel the engineering process. 



I can't help but imagine the endless possibilities of quickly simulating design choices and making data-driven decisions on the spot. No more tedious data transfer between tools. The future of engineering is looking brighter every day with these open-source solutions.



What do you think? Have you used **𝗝𝘂𝗽𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗿** or **𝗘𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗽𝘀𝗲 𝗦𝗶𝗿𝗶𝘂𝘀** in your work? How? Would you consider it ?
