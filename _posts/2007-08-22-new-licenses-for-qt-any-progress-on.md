A few days ago the [trolls](https://www.trolltechs.com/) opened their [great framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_%28toolkit%29) a bit more, adding [new licence exceptions](https://trolltech.com/products/qt/gplexception) on their Free Software edition. This means Qt software can be used along with a larger range of other Free Software libraries and dependencies. One of these licenses is the “Common Public License - 1.0”.

Discussions took place a long time ago about using QT as a toolkit for Eclipse (the same way we use GTK) and AFAIK the blocking point was its license. As a Linux user I’m a big fan of QT and I often cries concerning the GTK slowness. QT applications feel a lot more responsive and each release brings really nice features like a broad SVG support or soon a [webkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webkit) component. Moreover this toolkit is cross-platform, I had a chance to use it coding a Python/QT application and it was effectively working on Linux/Windows and MacOSX without recompilation providing a native look and feel.

Lately Trolltech went toward the Java world with [QT Jambi](https://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/qtjambi-techpreview), and more especially toward [Eclipse](https://trolltech.com/company/newsroom/announcements/press.2007-05-24.8884335791) providing a full set of plugins for user interfaces design.

Did this licenses extension changed something concerning an eventual SWT/QT integration? Does anybody want to share information?
