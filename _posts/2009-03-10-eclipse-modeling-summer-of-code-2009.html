you're a student interested in software development and engineering, Eclipse is a great place for a <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">Summer of Code </span>!<br /><br />New ideas are still appearing on the<a
	href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php?title=Google_Summer_of_Code_2009_Ideas"> wiki page</a> and no doubt you'll
get many more in a few weeks. Let me highlight some of the cool subjects you might apply for if you're interested in
modeling.<br /><br />Let's speak about <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/EMF_Compare">EMF Compare</a>, we tried to focus
on <span style="font-weight: bold;">cool stuffs</span> as that's what open source is about.<br /><br /><a
	onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"
	href="https://cedric.brun.io/images/blog/2009/Java3DFeedbackFigure.jpg"><img
		style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 156px;"

	visualization</span> ! Using EMF Compare, the GMF Diagram support and <a
	href="https://www.eclipse.dev/proposals/gef3d/">GEF 3D</a>, one can imagine to get a nice "time machine like"
visualization of the model differences. One can easily imagine really nice representation using that third dimension, we
have to display two (or three) versions of a diagram annotating the diagram elements with graphical hints saying "that's
a new element", or "this one has been changed", so 3D can make sense here.<br /><a

	models comparison <span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span></span>by huge we mean <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">really</span> huge like millions of elements. EMF Compare uses an heuristic-based
algorithm to compare two models, while doing so its keeping processing data in memory (more important the models are,
the more memory is used). The subject is two folds : first design and implements a MatchEngine needing less stuffs in
memory, then leverage Eclipse technologies like <a href="https://www.eclipse.dev/modeling/emf/?project=cdo#cdo">CDO</a>
or <a href="https://www.eclipse.dev/modeling/emft/?project=jcrm">JCRManagement</a> in order to break the memory bound !
That may seems trivial, but when you need to process a lot of data, <a
	href="https://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/11/scale_how_large_quantities_of.php">many parameters are
	changing.</a><br /><br />Third : improving the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Graphical Compare</span>'" proof of
concept initiated by Tobias (<a href="https://literate.modeling.free.fr/modeling/compare/GMFCompareEcoredi.htm">flash
	demo here</a>) .<br /><br />Many more ideas are available and looks really cool especially in the modeling area, so
If you're a student, jump and meet the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse Community</span> !
