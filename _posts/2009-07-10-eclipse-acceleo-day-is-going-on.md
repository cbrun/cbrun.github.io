[Eclipse Acceleo Day](https://www.eclipse.dev/org/press-release/20090618_AcceleoDay.php) started this morning. The event is collocated with the "**Libre Software Meeting**" at Nantes (France). Yes, that's right â€” we're part of this huge and lively movement which is **free software**.

So far the event is going fairly well and many people from convinced users to modeling skeptical ones are attending. Getting feedback from the end user is **always valuable**.

I'll keep the Eclipse community in touch with what's going on here; thanks again to [Freddy](https://freddyallilaire.blogspot.com/) who organized the event and to the foundation staff for their help!
