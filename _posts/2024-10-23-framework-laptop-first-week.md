I received and assembled my new Framework Laptop 13″ DIY edition last week, and after a week of use, I’m impressed. The assembly process was straightforward, and I was able to transfer my hard drive directly from my previous laptop (which had—again—a swelling battery after a few years of use).

It’s refreshing to have a device that works seamlessly with Linux right out of the box. The build quality is solid—fully comparable to some top‑tier brands—but what really stands out is how repairable and modular it is. Most parts use standard specs and are easy to replace, which makes maintenance practical over the long run.

Shout‑out to Mélanie Bats, the pioneer at Obeo for adopting the Framework laptop — I followed her lead. Perfect timing too: this lands just before the Open Community Experience in Germany. If you’re curious about the event, here’s my write‑up: [OCX 2024]({{ site.url }}/eclipse/ocx-open-community-experience-2024/).

If you care about sustainability, ease of repair, and Linux support, the Framework Laptop is worth a serious look.
