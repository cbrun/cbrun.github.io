The **indigo** release will be the first year the Eclipse Modeling package is no more marked as "incubating". As I'm checking the status of every component I'm wondering: do you, end users of the package, want an SDK package or not?

I, as of now, considered that using EMF&co without the SDK was a real pain, but maybe I'm not the best representative and I'd like your feedback. Especially considering that now with the provisioning capabilities of Eclipse we also have a third option: transforming your non-SDK to an SDK package in one click.

So here is the poll; it will stay online for one week and it needs, like, 2 secs for you to fill:

What are the implications? Non-SDK package means a smaller package (around 100 MB probably) or a package with more modeling tools. On the other end SDK package means you can start using EMF&co as frameworks right away.

The poll will be on for a few days â€” go ahead and pick your choice!
