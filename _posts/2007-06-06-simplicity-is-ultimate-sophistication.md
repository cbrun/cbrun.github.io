Leonardo Da Vinci was damn right about it, and Acceleo 2.0 is just another step in the right direction. As planned we released this new stable version today. Have a look at the [new and noteworthy](https://www.acceleo.org/pages/new-and-noteworthy-acceleo-2-0-0/) to get an idea of the exciting features.

Ready-to-use bundles are available on the [download page](https://www.acceleo.org/pages/download-acceleo-2-0-0/) providing Eclipse, Acceleo, its dependencies, the whole set of generator modules and useful other plugins like Subversive or Topcased.

This release marks the opening of the project to a broader community: people gathered to provide open source generator modules for [JEE, CSharp, Php or Python](https://www.acceleo.org/pages/modules-repository/). This set is made of stable and feature-full generators but also of experimental ones. I do not forget about generators not yet ready to be released, mentioning Wisss or Enterprise Application — no doubt they will soon bring new exciting technologies!

The Acceleo website had a huge makeover for the 2.0.0 release, more especially in the [documentation](https://www.acceleo.org/pages/introduction/) and [development](https://www.acceleo.org/pages/development/) sections. Speaking about documentation another great news is the fact that the [“Obeo advanced documentation”](https://www.obeosoft.com/fr/pages/acceleo/doc/) is now free for a commercial use too!

Don’t miss the new [“Take Part in Acceleo”](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014071148/https://www.acceleo.org/pages/participez-au-projet-acceleo/) page, opening to various contributions users, architects or developers are able to do.

Still, to get to ultimate sophistication, we need your feedback! Do not hesitate to interact with the team!
