First time blogging, many first times these days :)

As the EMF Compare project lead I had to go to [EclipseCon](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/), the component has just been accepted so it was the first time for me to follow EclipseCon from the inside and not from Planet Eclipse. The event was just great, the interesting people are countless and the Eclipse world is amazing by many aspects. I attended many talks, for a modelling guy like me many stuffs were interesting.

EMF/EMFT was present everywhere, it’s the basis for many tools and software and it deserves to, it just cover the need everybody has using data and models, serialization, notification, validation, transaction or now relational database storage thanks to the Teneo project.

EclipseCon allow you to meet the people behind all these projects and to have a quick glance of the other projects, the data binding stuffs were just great as the [Zest framework](https://www.eclipse.dev/mylar/zest.php) from Ian Bull and the [UML talk](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/index.php?page=sub/&id=3703) done by Kenn Hussey.

I did a panel there about the EMF Compare component with Antoine Toulme, Jean Bezivin, and Ed Merks, it was quite good as the audience had many reactions. I emphasized there the fact that we are aiming to provide a great basis for other tools to work with, a basic UI for comparison and merge (same as the JDT) but no diagram support yet. As the tool is metamodel agnostic, meaning you are able to compare UML or Ecore or anything else, questions were asked about providing special behavior like, for instance, custom dependencies management while merging. Good point there, we’ll try to provide a mechanism for that!

I also did a poster session about the code generator Acceleo, nice reactions there too, people would like to use a MDA approach but most of the tools are quite hard to tackle, Acceleo is just great about that, it’s easy to install, to use and you may generate any kind of text.

In a nutshell the event was great, special thanks to all the staff there and I’m looking forward to see everybody back at Eclipse Summit!
