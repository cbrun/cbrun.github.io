We're working a lot on Obeo Designer 5.0 — release planned for Q1 2011 — on the traceability support and the **next-gen model to text transformation language**.

Concerning the editing and diagramming support, changes are more subtle though powerful. Here is a quick glimpse on the latest milestone:

The most visible change is the work on the diagram ergonomy; the user interface has been cleaned up, streamlined, and features are more accessible. The global toolbar has been replaced with a **dedicated toolbar embedded** in the diagram editor providing access to the filters and the enablement of layers.

The contextual actions have been re-organized too.

If you're used to nice Eclipse editors you'll be happy to learn that the "Quick Outline" (summoned thanks to CTRL+O) is available in the diagrams now. Just type in any word here, and the corresponding model element will be revealed in your diagram.

If you don't know about Obeo Designer and you want to set up a dedicated design + transformation toolchain for your domain, [have a look here](https://www.obeosoft.com/fr/pages/obeo-designer/).

Here is a flash demo being a recap of these features:
