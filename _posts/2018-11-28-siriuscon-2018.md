Each year November and December months are what I would call "very busy months", but each year I have this event I know will be awesome which is **[SiriusCon](https://www.siriuscon.org/)**.

[Eclipse Sirius](https://www.eclipse.dev/sirius/) is a technology used to create **modeling environments** using graphical modelers, tables, trees or form editors. This technology is an enabler to **capture your expertise, your methodology** and then share it within your organization or toward customers. Compared to other comparable technologies Sirius gives results with low efforts, does not require you to be able to code and is **Open-Source** with a license which does not restrict your ability to deliver your tool the way you see fit.


**SiriusCon** is THE event for graphical modeling, an opportunity to get experience reports from users of the technology, to expose and discuss the project progress, to share roadmaps and to engage with the community.


Obeo has been hosting SiriusCon **3 years in a row** in Paris, each edition was a success and an energizing moment for the teams and me.


Sirius **as a technology** is evolving, improving on the user experience of diagram editors, offering new features and simultaneously embracing the web and cloud-based environments.


Sirius **as a community** is growing, the [project forum](https://www.eclipse.dev/forums/eclipse.sirius) see more newcomers, basically one every 3 days while on the same period last year it was one every 4 days.

The Sirius community knows no border users Japan, North Africa, Canada, United States, Columbia and many other countries reached out to us while they are building their domain specific tooling on top of Sirius. It became obvious that we had to evolve our event.

Hence, **SiriusCon Live!**

The event is now Online, **fully accessible through the web** and composed of two half days: the first one more interesting to explorers getting in touch with the technology (4th of December) while the second half-day  will feature more technical content (5th of December).

We kept the same principles: deep technical content, feedback from the trenches, exclusive information about the roadmap and the community involvement to set the pace for the next few years!

I for one am excited to hear experience reports from the **NASA** - Robust Software Engineering Group when the Insight Lander just arrived on Mars, from the **CEA** - DAM which have to manage incredibly complex simulations, from **Atrris Corporation** in Japan, building their RAD tool, Pexa, from **Altran - Netherlands** which went deep in integrating Xtext editors and Sirius Diagrams, from **I-BP** which improved the user experience of their tool by leveraging the form based editors and from **Thales** which have a unique perspective as they are building Capella on top of Sirius for more than 10 years now.
