When I discovered the [NodeBox project](https://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home), that thought (in fact — a [book title](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be)) immediately caught my mind.

Tufte is right when he says that “The commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly — to develop strategies of seeing and showing.” Analysis needs relevant and beautiful representations. Here these representations may be animated, and that’s another big point: the first purpose of our mind associated with our eye is to analyse moving representations and find visual inconsistencies.

The [gallery](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014071148/https://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Gallery) provided for that tool is just amazing, mixing different research domains, using the web as an information pool and providing “near artistic” representations.

Do I need to say this project is made in [Python](https://www.python.org/)? Well, most of the time, projects using many other libraries and gluing them in order to provide unexpected results tend to be in Python. The bad news about this one is it seems to be exclusively MacOSX compatible, but let’s hope the [2.0 release](https://research.nodebox.net/NodeBoxDev) using [Jython](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014071148/https://www.jython.org/Project/index.html) will hit the ground soon. This one could work, at least, on Windows.
