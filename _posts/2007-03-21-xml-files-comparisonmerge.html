On the EMFT mailling-list Martin Taal asked me if EMF compare component was usefull when one has to handle XML file.<br /><br />Thanks to the EMF/XSD project this feature just comes at no cost ! If you create your metamodel using an XSD then the model will be serialized in it’s native XML format but in the emf compare point of view it’s just another EMF model ! Then you’re able to compare, and of course merge modifications on the files.<br />Here’s a screenshot of the tool comparing two XML files coming from the well known “Library” example (sorry I did not put nice icons on the models ;) )<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SXsDG5Moo5I/AAAAAAAAAFY/kxbeVOlsmFU/s1600-h/emfcomparexml.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 294px;" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SXsDG5Moo5I/AAAAAAAAAFY/kxbeVOlsmFU/s400/emfcomparexml.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5294829203872064402" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br />The XSD project really should have more visibility, it’s obviously usefull in many use cases where XML matters and EMF provides so much nice features, you should not miss that !
