I can’t believe we are already looking at Q4. I have so much news to share with you!

### Eclipse Sirius, Obeo Cloud Platform and Sirius Web:

This last summer we had the pleasure to organize SiriusCon. This one-day event is each year the opportunity for the modeling community to share their experience, and for the development team to provide visibility on what is currently being worked on and how we see the future of the technology. SiriusCon reached **450 attendees** from **53 different countries** thanks to **13 fabulous speakers** !

The latest edition was special to us, it used to be organized at the end of each year but we decided to postpone it for a few months to be ready for an announcement very close to our heart. We’ve been working on bringing on the Web what we love about Sirius for quite a few years already and reached a point where we have a promising product. Now is the time to accelerate, Mélanie Bats announced it during the conference: **we are releasing “Sirius Web” as Open-Source and officially** [started the countdown](https://blog.obeosoft.com/fr/sirius-ii-mission){:target="_blank"} !

The reactions to this announcement were fantastic with a lot of excitement within the community.


I am myself very excited for several reasons:


Firstly, I expect this decision will, just like Sirius Desktop was released in Open-Source in 2013, **a key factor leading to the creation of hundreds of graphical modelers**, in the same way currently demonstrated by the [Sirius Gallery](https://www.eclipse.dev/sirius/gallery.html){:target="_blank"} but now easily accessible through the Web and leveraging all the capabilities this platform brings. 



Our vision is to empower the tool specifier from the data structure and tool definition up to the deployment and exploitation of a modeling tool, **directly from the browser, end to end and in an integrated and seamless way.** 



We are not there yet, though as you’ll see the technology is already quite promising.

Secondly, for Obeo this decision strengthens our product-based business model while being faithful to our “open core” approach. **We will offer, through Obeo Cloud Platform a Sirius Web build extended with Enterprise features**, to deploy on public, private clouds or on premise and including support and upgrade guarantees.

Since the announcement the team is working on Sirius Web to publish it as an Open-Source product so that you can start experimenting as soon as EclipseCon 2020. Mélanie will present this in detail during her talk: ["Sirius Web: 100% open source cloud modeling platform"](https://www.eclipsecon.org/node/3210){:target="_blank"} ,

Hint: it’s still time to register for EclipseCon 2020 but do it quickly! The program committee did an excellent job in setting up an exciting program thanks to your many submissions, don’t miss it!

### Capella Days Online is coming up!

That’s not it! Each day we see Eclipse Capella get more and more adoption across the globe, this Open-Source product has its own 4-days event: Capella Days Online 2020!

A unique occasion to get many experience reports from multiple domains: Space systems (CNES and GMV), Rail and transportation (Virgin Hyperloop, Nextrail and Vitesco technologies), healthcare (Siemens and Still AB), waste collecting with The SeaCleaners and all of that in addition to aerospace, defence and security with Thales Group. The program is packed with high-quality content: 12 sessions over 4 days from October 12th to 15th, more than 500 attendees already registered, join us and register!

###  SmartEA 6.0 supports Archimate 3.1 and keeps rising!

We use those open-source technologies, like Eclipse Sirius, Acceleo, EMF Compare, M2doc and many more in our “off the shelf” software solution for Enterprise Architecture: **Obeo SmartEA**.

This spring we released SmartEA 6.0, which got the Archimate 3.1 certification and brought among many other improvements: new modeling capabilities, extended user management, enhanced BPMN modeling and streamlined user experience.

Our solution is a challenger on the market and convinces more and more customers. *Stay tuned, I should be able to share a thrilling announcement soon!*


###  World Clean Up Day and The SeaCleaners

In a nutshell: an excellent dynamic on many fronts and exciting challenges ahead!
This is all made possible thanks to the energy and cohesion of the Obeo team in this weird, complex and unusual time. We are committed to the environment and to reduce plastic waste, as such we took part in the [World Clean Up Day](https://www.worldcleanupday.fr/){:target="_blank"}  in partnership with [The Sea Cleaners](https://www.theseacleaners.org/){:target="_blank"} . Beyond the impact of this action which has so much sense to us, it was also a sharing and fun moment!
