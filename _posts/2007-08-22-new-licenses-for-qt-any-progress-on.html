<div class="entry"> <div class="content"> <p>A few days ago the <a href="https://www.trolltechs.com/">trolls</a> opened their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_%28toolkit%29">great framework</a> a bit more adding <a href="https://trolltech.com/products/qt/gplexception">new licence exceptions</a> on their Free Software edition. This means Qt software can be used along with a larger range of other Free Software libraries and dependencies. One of these licenses is the ” Common Public License - 1.0″.</p> <p>Discussions took place a long time ago about using QT as a toolkit for Eclipse (the same way we use GTK) and AFAIK the blocking point was its license. As a Linux user I’m a big fan of QT and I often cries concerning the GTK slowness. QT applications feel a lot more responsive and each release brings really nice features like a broad SVG support or soon a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webkit">webkit </a>component. Moreover this toolkit is cross-platform, I had a chance to use it coding a Python/QT application and it was effectively working on Linux/Windows and MacOSX without recompilation providing a native look and feel.</p> <p>Lately Trolltech went toward the Java world with<a href="https://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/qtjambi-techpreview"> </a><a href="https://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/qtjambi-techpreview">QT Jambi</a>, and more especially toward <a href="https://trolltech.com/company/newsroom/announcements/press.2007-05-24.8884335791">Eclipse</a> providing a full set of plugins for user interfaces design.</p> <p>Did this licenses extension changed something concerning an eventual SWT/QT integration ? Do anybody want to share information ? </p> </div> </div>
