I'm back from a full week at Devoxx in Antwerpen- Belgium. I was there to present the Sirius
project and <br />Eclipse Modeling at the Eclipse Foundation booth. (by the way, thanks again to the foundation staff !)
<br />It was quite fun to be there with Jelena Alter, Marcel Bruch, Julien Vermillard and Gael Blondelle, we had a good
mix of things : Marcel for the Java developpers with Code Recommender, Julien for M2M stuff (which was very hot at
Devoxx this year) Jelena and Gael for the Eclipse Foundation itself and me with fancy graphical
modelers.<br /><br /><br />

<br /><br /><br />Here are a few random notes :<br /><br />The conference organization and setup is quite amazing. Wifi
worked very well, the venue is a theather complex which means you always get to sit very confortably and the screens are
just huge. There was some hacking spaces with peoples hanging there all the time, voting was easy thanks to a bunch of
arduino modules installed in each room. Interactions were encouraged with tweets being displayed on every screen in
between the sessions, "free to use" whiteboards were positionned in the hallway leading to some wild polls. I liked
these small things which are triggering more involvement from the audience.<br /><br /><a

very good in general but could not attend many sessions as I had many
things going on at the booth too, but overall I was impressed. It's not perfect though, I had my share of "sexy looking
talks" which did end up being very badly presented.<br /><br />In the end I have seen only a few Java talks, many
sessions were related to web dev, cloud, or the now famous "Internet of Things".<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I was
there as an Eclipse guy and believe me, the Eclipse hoodie is like a secret weapon to get to talk to pretty much any
programming rock star. On the other hand there is this trend going on in the Java community about Eclipse being really
bad compared to the competition which made me a bit reluctant first, will people attack me there ?<br /><br />After
speaking with many Java developpers during the conference here is my report : most of them are loving Eclipse, as an
IDE.<br />Juno was a lot of pain though and they did not understood why it got released with such poor performances and
behavior. They like Eclipse Kepler way better but it's still not exactly on par with what they used to expect, and they
expect a lot from Luna, in particular :<br /><br />
<ul>
	<li>Performances and responsiveness</li>
	<li>Quality and reliability, no more ui glitches in the workbench.</li>
	<li>Java 8 support.</li>
	<li>Maven integration (Many people have given up on this one starting from Juno...)</li>
</ul><br />In the end the differences between the major IDEs are quite small and we have room for improvements in
several points, but users have pain with IntelliJ too.<br /><br />What about innovative features ? Actually Code
Recommender in itself impressed many peoples, and the others could quite easily be impressed with features which have
been around for years through specific plugins they did not knew about.<br /><br />In a way that was kind of a relief
for me to see that our work was not completely rejected by the community and that people could say things like:
<i>"Eclipse is the best for this, or that" </i>(for instance having support for multiple languages in the same IDE).
&nbsp;Also, several sessions presenting very cool stuff that could not have existed without Eclipse.<br />

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />But on the other hand it is very
hype to reject and bash Eclipse when you want to brag as a speaker.<br /><br />Of course it was also a great occasion
try a few ideas discussed here and there lately. I realized that :<br /><br />
<ul>
	<li>"Code Recommender" in itself makes people wanting to use Eclipse again for Java.</li>
	<li>most of them don't understand what they are downloading from Eclipse.org and the whole idea behind the release
		train. They could not really figure out which "thing" they should download between "Classic", "Java" or "JEE".
	</li>
	<li>most did tell me they downloaded "Eclipse" (which means, for instance, the Java package) and were surprised that
		it was not having the X or Y feature - which actually is part of the release train. &nbsp;They just have no clue
		how to discover that.</li>
	<li>nobody wanted the <b>"uber package"</b> : that would make an un-usable IDE and they don't want feature they
		don't use to interact with others (and the bloat)</li>
	<li>the "let's display fake wizards which are provisionning the IDE on demand" was midly received. Most people I
		talked too want to be sure they won't need to install something more once they prepared their setup.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>a "configurator wizard" opening up the first time so that the developpers gets to pick what kind of langage
		support he wants, which SCM integrations, which bug tracker and so on, kinda excited the crowd. They see that as
		the perfect way to provision <b>just</b> the Eclipse they want withouth needing to figure out what all these
		weird feature names are meaning and knowing this is a selection of high quality plugins, all of them being
		open-source.</li>
	<li>only a few would be willing to pay for Eclipse, even if it is a special version, and even if it's a very low
		price. They are used to Eclipse being free and are more willing to click donate than to buy the binary. By the
		way, they feel like when they click on this donate bouton, they are already helping the development of Eclipse
		as an IDE.</li>
	<li>many features of Eclipse, even if they can be installed through the release train and can be usefull for a
		developper, are not known at all. (the configurator wizard could help here too). This is, again, probably the
		smallest effort on our side to have the highest impact.</li>
	<li>several were using Eclipse as a platform, to build applications or tools, and they could not find the same level
		of flexibility and extensibility in any other platform out there.</li>
</ul>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This is it for "Eclipse as an IDE".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Regarding Sirius, I had very good feedback. People were either curious about it or left with the idea of trying it
	in their own context, which was more than I could expect from such a conference !<br /><br />
