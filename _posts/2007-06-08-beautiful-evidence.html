When I discovered the <a href="https://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home"> NodeBox project</a>, that thought (in fact - a
<a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be">book title</a> ) immediatly catched my mind.<br />
<div class="entry">
	<div class="content">
		<p>Tufte is right when he says that <em>“The commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly
				- to develop strategies of seeing and showing.”</em>, analysis needs relevent and beautiful
			representations. Here these representations may be animated, and that’s another big point, the first purpose
			of our mind associated with our eye is to <strong>analyse moving representations and finding out visual
				inconsistencies</strong>.</p>
		<p>The <a

			</a> provided for that tool is just amazing, mixing different research domains, using the web as an
			information pool and providing “near artistic” representation. </p>

		<p>Do I need to say this project is made in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> ? Well, most of the time, projects using many other libraries gluing them
			in order to provide unexpected results tend to be in Python. The bad news about this one is it seems to be
			exclusively MacOSX compatible, but lets hope the <a
				href="https://research.nodebox.net/NodeBoxDev">2.0
				release</a> using <a
				href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071014071148/https://www.jython.org/Project/index.html">Jython</a>
			will hit the ground soon, this one could work, at least, on Windows. </p>
