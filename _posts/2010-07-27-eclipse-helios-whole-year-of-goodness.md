Eclipse Helios is a release, but it's also a complete development cycle in a global and distributed team of committers. Since I chose [3 features](/2010/06/28/helios-review-in-pictures.html) I especially liked in **Helios** this kept bugging me: what is _Helios_ to me?

Helios will have its place in my memory — not the bits themselves but good things we had **as a community**.

1. The Acceleo Community joins Eclipse.org and starts by using **black magic** to build bits

   It's just the beginning of this move but so far it went pretty well :)

2. [Eclipse Summit Europe](https://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2010/) is the best Eclipse conference to meet friends

3. The dreaded diamonds of the Simultaneous Release are still haunting my dreams...

4. Our friend Hudson is now serving way more projects, but not always happily.

5. The Foundation keeps moving things forward

6. [EMF Compare](https://wiki.eclipse.org/EMF_Compare) rocked at [Eclipse Con 2010](/2010/03/24/diff-merge-and-patch-your-models-with.html)

Last but not least, this Helios cycle was filled with more interactions with end-users and adopters leading to nice enhancements in Eclipse as a whole — **thanks for your help!**
