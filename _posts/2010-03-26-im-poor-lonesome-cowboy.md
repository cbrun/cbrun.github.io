I'm a long long way from home.

And this poor lonesome cowboy.

Has got a long long way to roam ...

That's right, EclipseCon 2010 is over. Each year it gets better and better and leaving it is always a bit sad. I'll use this blog post as a memento of my feelings and the things I noticed during this week:

- Many people are using **EMF Compare**. That should not be a surprise as it provides a key feature for anybody working with models, but still it gives me a warm feeling :) The ECon attendees provided me a lot of very relevant feedback; among others it looks like scalability is not so nice when one is using a big model. Don't worry, I'll work on that (in fact I already started) and you can expect a performance boost, even for the generic engine. More of that in a future blog post with figures.
- People are now used to the idea of **e4 is going to exist**; it will provide new means for writing applications. I also have the feeling that people understood that e4 is going to be what **WE** — as a community — want it to be.
- **Chocolate fountains** are not mandatory, but some bugs will always arise ([bug 300500](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=300500)).
- ATL is definitely THE model-to-model transformation language — it's **mature**, and now thanks to William's work the tooling is a bit **closer to the perfection**.
- CDO is one of the most amazing frameworks I had the chance to use. It's quite unbelievable that such a **small and slim framework can provide such power**. You need years of engineering and [professionalism](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2010/sessions/?page=sessions&id=1588) to achieve this. Congrats to the whole CDO Team!
- I have a lot of hope for the **Mylyn Review** project; the approach is simple but perfect for people like me — it will just be "yet another key feature" of the IDE. In fact the whole Mylyn project is providing, as usual, innovations.
- The **Sharks Rocks**! They blasted the Dallas Stars! And I guess I'll be more interested in hockey now :)
- [Pascal](https://lenettoyeur-on-eclipse.blogspot.com/) has not been abducted by aliens; he is still the same, although being transformed into a Maven guy now.
- **Modeling** is everywhere. It's just pervading everything: from your IP Log to the next generation platform you'll rely on.
- End users really appreciated the work I did on the **modeling package**. Here again, thanks for your feedback.
- Xtext was everywhere, and will be a key asset for the **upcoming IDE generation**.
- The Eclipse Foundation did a **tremendous work** for this event, and it's been perfect! Thanks again!
- **Acceleo** is so powerful that many people expressed their wish to use it for their code generation needs: step one on the "taking over the world" plan is validated.
- Nasa, Rockets and Robots are **cool**.
- The **Architecture Council** is taking more and more initiative and [Martin](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Martin_Oberhuber) is doing a great job driving it.
- Then you start smoothly, learn things and code: I can **fill my addiction**.
- It's possible to create a conference program of high quality (the best I had in the previous four years to my opinion), with such a diverse community. **Kuddos to Oisin!**

I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting things, but anyway, I really need to sleep now...

In a nutshell: **the best conference ever** :)
