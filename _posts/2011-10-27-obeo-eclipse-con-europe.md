Obeo invests a lot in Eclipse projects (yes, we are a [Strategic Member](https://www.eclipse.dev/membership/showMembersWithTag.php?TagID=strategic) of the Eclipse Foundation); we're building, in the open, the modeling platform we need for our [product](https://www.obeodesigner.com/).

Conferences like the upcoming Eclipse Con Europe are great time for our team: we get to meet people we usually interact with using mails or bugzilla, adopters using our technologies; we get to have an insider sight of what is going on here and there, and we're pleased to show to others what we did in the generic technologies or how those pieces are used for domain-specific needs.

This year the Obeo'ers are co-presenting or presenting numerous talks covering a wide spectrum (see program for full details). Take this chance to discuss with the team!

Unfortunately I won't be able to make it this year. I'll celebrate the 10th birthday of Eclipse through Twitter/G+ â€” so pleeeeease, tweet-it!

On the other hand I will present at [Eclipse Day Paris](https://www.eclipsedayparis.com/): **What the heck is Eclipse Modeling and why should you care?** I'm looking forward to meet you there!
