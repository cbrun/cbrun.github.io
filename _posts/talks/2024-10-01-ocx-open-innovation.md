excerpt: "OCX 2024 talk resources for Eclipse/MBSE practitioners—context, slides, and why open innovation and stewardship matter now."
---

For open‑source leaders, engineering managers, and foundation stewards who care about building sustainable ecosystems. The talk shares how Obeo’s 19‑year journey leverages open innovation and stewardship to align business value with community health in a fast‑moving regulatory context.

## Key Takeaways
- Stewardship over ownership: governance and ecosystems drive durable value.
- Open innovation flywheel: partners, contributors, and users accelerate outcomes.
- Regulatory readiness: collaborate early on compliance (e.g., CRA) without slowing innovation.

## Abstract
Open innovation is more than code—it’s a system of incentives, governance, and community stewardship that compounds value for everyone involved. Drawing on Obeo’s history in Eclipse projects (Sirius, EMF Compare, SysON) and industry collaborations, this talk unpacks how to structure partnerships, sustain contributor motivation, and stay ahead of regulatory changes like the Cyber Resilience Act. It highlights practical patterns that help leaders scale impact while keeping ecosystems healthy.
