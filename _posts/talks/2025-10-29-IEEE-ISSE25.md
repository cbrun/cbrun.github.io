## Context

- **Event:** [2025 IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering (ISSE)](https://2025.ieeeisse.org/)  
- **Location:** ENSTA, Paris  
- **Date:** October 2025

## Summary

This joint presentation explored how **open-source MBSE technologies** have evolved over the past 15 years — from Eclipse-based industrial tools like **Capella**, **Papyrus**, and **Sirius**, to new **web-native** environments supporting **SysML v2** and agent-assisted engineering.

Key messages included:
- The power of **open ecosystems** for accelerating innovation in education, research, and industry.  
- Lessons learned from large-scale industrial adoption of MBSE tools.  
- The emergence of **next-generation modeling environments** — collaborative, extensible, and AI-augmented, bridging the gap between domain experts and software engineers.

The talk sparked **lively discussions** and a **strong interest from the IEEE community** regarding the convergence of open-source platforms and upcoming SysML v2 tooling.

## Highlights

- **15 years of open collaboration** across the Eclipse ecosystem — from early Papyrus and Capella foundations to today’s vibrant MBSE community.  
- **Industry-proven tools at scale**, including Capella and its extensions (Team, Cloud, and Publication), showcasing how open-source can sustain mission-critical engineering.  
- A **live proof of concept** illustrating “Obeo Enterprise for SysON,” combining SysML v2 with Arcadia semantics and an **AI agent** assisting the creation of a logical architecture for the X-Wing spacecraft.  
- A **forward-looking perspective** on the transition to **web-native**, **cloud-enabled**, and **AI-augmented** modeling platforms built for openness and collaboration.
