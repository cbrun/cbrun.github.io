## Summary

This joint presentation explored how **open-source MBSE technologies** have evolved over the past 15 years,  from Eclipse-based industrial tools like **Capella**, **Papyrus**, and **Sirius**, to new **web-native** environments supporting **SysML v2** and agent-assisted engineering.

Key messages included:
- The power of **open ecosystems** for accelerating innovation in education, research, and industry.  
- Lessons learned from large-scale industrial adoption of MBSE tools.  
- The emergence of **next-generation modeling environments** — collaborative, extensible, and AI-augmented — bridging the gap between domain experts and software engineers.

The talk sparked **lively discussions** and a **strong interest from the IEEE community** regarding the convergence of open-source platforms and upcoming SysML v2 tooling.
