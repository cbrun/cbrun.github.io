In this talk, I take you on a whirlwind tour of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) ecosystem. In just 25 minutes, I go through 15 different projects, each one explained with the same rhythm: what it does, where it fits, and how you can use it. From the early building blocks like **EcoreTools** and **Xcore**, to collaboration enablers like **CDO**, **EMF Compare**, and **M2Doc**, I wanted to give a sense of how these open-source projects connect and evolve.

The format is deliberately fast-paced : 1 minute 30 seconds per project, so you get a quick but structured overview. Some slides are just prompts for live commentary, others show actual code and UI demos. Put together, they highlight the diversity of EMF projects and their role in making modeling practical, collaborative, and extensible.

### Key Points

* **Goal**: a 25-minute tour of 15 EMF projects.
* **Format**: 1 min 30 per project, with a consistent structure (scope, example, feedback).
* **Projects I covered**:

  * *EcoreTools* – graphical modeler for Ecore.
  * *Xcore* – textual modeling with Java integration.
  * *EEF* – rich property dialogs and editors.
  * *CDO* – collaborative model repository.
  * *EMF Compare* – differencing and merging for models.
  * *EMFPath* – concise navigation/query APIs.
  * *emfjson* – JSON ↔ EMF integration.
  * *Gendoc2* – document generation from models.
  * *mongoEMF* & *Neo4j integration* – NoSQL persistence.
  * *EMF Specimen* – automatic model instance generation.
  * *EMF Client Platform* – framework for RCP apps.
  * *Texo* – JPA and enterprise integration.
  * *Sonar Regex Filter* – exclude generated code from analysis.
  * *Wikitext/Intent bridge* – models from wiki pages.
* **Style**: mix of links, code examples, and live commentary.
