excerpt: "Hands‑on modeling challenge—resources and context for the EclipseCon 2008 Mega Modeling Mania."
---

For EclipseCon attendees interested in fast prototyping with modeling. This hands‑on challenge pushed teams to model, generate, and iterate quickly—surfacing patterns that still help today.

## Key Takeaways
- Rapid prototyping: start from the meta‑model, generate early, refine iteratively.
- Teamwork: split roles (meta‑model, templates, runtime) to move faster.
- Fun matters: engaging exercises help teams internalize modeling practices.

## Context
- Event: EclipseCon, San Francisco
- Date: 2008
- Program: [https://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/index17da.html?page=sub/&id=564](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/index17da.html?page=sub/&id=564)
