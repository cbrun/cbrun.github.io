excerpt: "Bringing documentation into the development loopâ€”Mylyn and Intent integration patterns."
draft: true

For teams struggling to keep docs up to date. We showed how Intent connects documentation to code and models and how Mylyn tasks/context keep work focused and traceable.

## Key Takeaways
- Single source of truth: docs linked to code and models.
- Traceability: tasks, changes, and docs stay in sync.
- Adoption: embed docs in everyday workflows, not side projects.
