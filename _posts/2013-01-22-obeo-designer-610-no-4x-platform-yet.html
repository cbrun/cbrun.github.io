product <a href="https://www.obeosmartea.com/">dedicated to EA</a>, celebrating our seventh birhtday, building
almost&nbsp;<a href="https://marketplace.obeonetwork.com/">20 modeling environmen</a>ts based DSLs and/or standards,
bringing model comparison<a href="https://fr.slideshare.net/mikaelbarbero/emfcompare-20-scaling-to-millions"> far beyond
</a>the competition, tackling the issue of software and design documentation with a <a
	href="https://www.eclipse.dev/intent/">novel approach in the Mylyn project</a>&nbsp;and step by step getting closer
to our perfect development process, our <b><a
		href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/98-days-1-our-continuous-deployment-pivot">unicorn</a></b>.<br /><br /><b>And</b>&nbsp;working
on Obeo Designer :&nbsp;we just released 6.1.0 bringing among other things :<br />&nbsp;- compatibility with Eclipse
<b>3.8</b> &nbsp;(and Indigo, and Helios)<br />&nbsp;- a ready-to-launch <b>server</b> for live and instant
collaboration on models with fine grained locks<br />&nbsp;- <b>token/floating licenses</b>, &nbsp;meaning you can now
buy license for, let's say, 30 simultaneous users, no matter who.<br />&nbsp;- a better packaging, documentation and
examples<br />&nbsp;- updated versions of all its OSS components : Acceleo, ATL, &nbsp;EEF, EMF
Compare.<br /><br />Rougly 160 tasks have been closed for this release not counting the work done on the OSS components,
it's quite hard to summarize but you can find<a href="https://www.obeodesigner.com/features/whatisnew"> a few highlights
	here</a>.<br /><br /><b>Why Eclipse 3.8 ?</b><br /><br />We worked on bringing the 4.2 compatibility &nbsp;for the
product (and are still working on it) but we got hit by <a
	href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=366528">some limitations </a>of the compatibility layer.
&nbsp;It was detected late as the problem came when we decided to rely more on the plaftorm mechanisms to get <a
	href="https://www.obeodesigner.com/features/whatisnew#extensible_tab_bar">more extensibility</a>... It's not trivial
to fix, we are trying to help the platform team as much as we can to implement this either in the 4.2 or 4.3
stream.<br /><br /><br />What does that mean ? It means on Eclipse 4.2 you don't get the diagram contextual toolbar,
also known as <i>TabBar</i>:<br /><br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a
		href="https://cedric.brun.io/images/blog/2013/graal-e4.png"
		imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300"

			width="400" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><br />This prevents end users
to enable/disable graphical layers or to switch to the "layout mode" (a.k.a. VI for diagrams).<br /><br />That's quite a
big loss for end users, you get used to this ability to apply layers on your diagram, but as I said, we're working on
it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Obeo Designer is an integrated platform to build modeling
environment. Using it you can quickly and easily leverage the power of the whole Eclipse Modeling eco-system : EMF, CDO,
Xtext, GMF, Acceleo, ATL, Compare.... It's packaged, tested and includes additional components to create richer modeling
environments, quicker.<br /><br />The problem with such a product is - as it's a base for you to build things - getting
what you can achieve with it can be hard. &nbsp;One example (among many on the Eclipse or <a
	href="https://marketplace.obeonetwork.com/">Obeo Marketplace</a>) of what you can do is the UML Designer. &nbsp;You
can install it from the marketplace, and you can have a look at the&nbsp;<a
	href="https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Modeling">sources here</a>. We've already seen 580 installations in the
last 5 days, yeah !<br />
<div><br /></div>Well, ok, But <b>what's really new in your product</b>&nbsp;?<br /><br />Many changes are not directly
visibles in this version, we streamlined the CDO and collaborative support, worked on performances, and introduced a few
nice features. Go have a look on the<a href="https://www.obeodesigner.com/features/whatisnew"> *new and noteworthy*</a>
page. This blog post is already filled with sentences making me sound like a boastful person. Ok. Just a small
glimpse...<br /><br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
</div><br />You can now use a new construction in your diagram definition : &nbsp;<b>Brackets</b><br /><br />Using those
you can easily represent intervals in a diagram. &nbsp;You can use it in a sequence diagram just like here, but also in
any other diagram.<br /><br />
