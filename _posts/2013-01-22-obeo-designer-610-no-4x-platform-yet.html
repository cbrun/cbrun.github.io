It's not trivial to fix, we are trying to help the platform team as much as we can to implement this either in the 4.2 or 4.3 stream.<br /><br /><br />What does that mean ? It means on Eclipse 4.2 you don't get the diagram contextual toolbar, also known as <i>TabBar</i>:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ENp5g23D8OY/UPlV1KchUUI/AAAAAAAAF4k/gZhUZcBbguc/s1600/graal-e4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ENp5g23D8OY/UPlV1KchUUI/AAAAAAAAF4k/gZhUZcBbguc/s400/graal-e4.png" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><a href="http://www.obeodesigner.com/images/stories/od60_feat/od6_feat_08.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://www.obeodesigner.com/images/stories/od60_feat/od6_feat_08.png" /></a><br />This prevents end users to enable/disable graphical layers or to switch to the "layout mode" (a.k.a. VI for diagrams).<br /><br />That's quite a big loss for end users, you get used to this ability to apply layers on your diagram, but as I said, we're working on it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Obeo Designer is an integrated platform to build modeling environment. Using it you can quickly and easily leverage the power of the whole Eclipse Modeling eco-system : EMF, CDO, Xtext, GMF, Acceleo, ATL, Compare.... It's packaged, tested and includes additional components to create richer modeling environments, quicker.<br /><br />The problem with such a product is - as it's a base for you to build things - getting what you can achieve with it can be hard. &nbsp;One example (among many on the Eclipse or <a href="http://marketplace.obeonetwork.com/">Obeo Marketplace</a>) of what you can do is the UML Designer. &nbsp;You can install it from the marketplace, and you can have a look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Modeling">sources here</a>. We've already seen 580 installations in the last 5 days, yeah !<br /><div><br /></div>Well, ok, But <b>what's really new in your product</b>&nbsp;?<br /><br />Many changes are not directly visibles in this version, we streamlined the CDO and collaborative support, worked on performances, and introduced a few nice features. Go have a look on the<a href="http://www.obeodesigner.com/features/whatisnew"> *new and noteworthy*</a> page. This blog post is already filled with sentences making me sound like a boastful person. Ok. Just a small glimpse...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.obeodesigner.com/images/gallery/system_engineering/timing_selection.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="198" src="http://www.obeodesigner.com/images/gallery/system_engineering/timing_selection.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />You can now use a new construction in your diagram definition : &nbsp;<b>Brackets</b><br /><br />Using those you can easily represent intervals in a diagram. &nbsp;You can use it in a sequence diagram just like here, but also in any other diagram.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.obeodesigner.com/images/stories/od61_nn/od-html-export.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="178" src="http://www.obeodesigner.com/images/stories/od61_nn/od-html-export.png" width="320" /></a></div>HTML Export : publish your model.
