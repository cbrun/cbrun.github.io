This post follows those showing how it's possible to leverage<a
	href="https://model-driven-blogging.blogspot.com/2009/05/live-models-using-jboss-rules-drools.html"> EMF and JBoss
	Drools</a> to get an interactive model getting updated considering business rules, and how you can get a set of <a
	href="https://model-driven-blogging.blogspot.com/2009/05/20-minute-graphical-modeler-based-on.html">graphical
	modelers</a> to ease your design tasks and provide feedback while you're building your system.<br /><br />Now let's
focus on providing <span style="font-style: italic;">"the right feedback at the right time"</span>. When you're
designing a system, you're trying to reach the following goal : building it <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">nicely</span> and making sure it fits <span style="font-weight: bold;">your requirements
	and contraints</span>. You're always balancing between different concerns, your system simplicity, agility,
performances, safety ...<br /><br />Having a good tooling for that is more than important, and the tooling failed since
now : it's always providing many more information or possible actions than what you actually need and not what's your
focus<span style="font-weight: bold;"> right now</span>.<br /><br />Here comes the viewpoints <a
	href="https://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/1471-2000_desc.html">(IEEE)</a> , viewpoints
enabled tooling is able to extends, hide, or provide new representations and actions depending on<span
	style="font-weight: bold;"> what you want to consider</span>. As building a system is always a trade-off between
multiples criteria, you don't want to be overwhelmed with all the constraints feedback, you just want to see <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">relevant</span> information and be able to do <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">relevant</span> actions. The concept is quite similar to the Eclipse
perspectives.<br /><br />The first demo (a few minutes) provides an overview of the <span
	style="font-style: italic;">tooling specification model</span> we started in the last post. It's been completed with
a few more representations, validation rules, and, more important, re-organized in term of <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">viewpoints.</span><br /><br /><a

usage of such a tooling, using (again) the simple "Flow" example.<br /><br /><a

	style="font-weight: bold;">is</span> great as a platform and enables you to build great tooling to that your users
stay focused on their business issues (which are complex enough already) . That's what we are trying to achieve with
this product.<br /><br />Moreover, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse Modeling</span> is a gem mine driven by
enthusiastic people, don't wait and come with us, <a
