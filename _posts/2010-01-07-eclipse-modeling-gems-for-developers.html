Eclipse is the best modeling platform around there, even <a
	href="https://ralph-at-eclipse.blog.de/2008/12/05/god-uses-emf-5167368/">god</a> knows that. What people tend to
ignore is that fact that the Eclipse Modeling components are focused on providing framework and tools to actually get
<span style="font-weight: bold;">some work done</span>, to <span style="font-weight: bold;">write better code
	quicker</span>, and not <span class="clickable" onclick="'dr4sdgryt(event,">necessarily model just because it's fun
	and you can then print huge posters in your office.</span><br /><a
	onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"
	href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fish2000/2339467813/"><img

you're writing code you can be pretty sure Eclipse Modeling might help you, do not wait to long to have a look or you'll
waste your time and <a href="https://thhal.blogspot.com/2009/10/lessons-learned-about-modeling.html">you'll regret that
	sooner or later</a>. All those gems are available through the Eclipse Modeling bundle and might help for <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">your daily development tasks</span>. I submitted a standard talk for EclipseCon to
demonstrate how the Eclipse Modeling Projets might <a
	href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/submissions/2010/view_talk.php?id=1171">boost your productivity when you integrate
	them in your development process just like the JDT, PDE or Mylyn, </a>if you want more info, ask for it through the
comments! I have no doubt <a href="https://oisinh.wordpress.com/">Oisin</a> is wrapping up a great event renewing its
spirit; I'm looking forward to it !<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"

briefly take a spin to one of those gems focusing on pragmatism : Acceleo. Acceleo is all about helping you to <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">generate code in a consistent way, within Eclipse, in a glimpse</span>. To do so you
usually use a template language and use some kind of expression substitution. Here the template language is quite
powerful, templates might call others and a template might inherit another one. The dispatch to the templates is dynamic
depending on the instance type (more specific first) and on the evaluation of any precondition on the templates (That
helps you design your templates in a maintainable way).<br /><br />Enough said about the language, lets focus on the
tooling to see how easy it is to leverage it for your coding. Let say you've got a specific pattern you reproduce quite
a lot in your code and you don't want to bother writing that code again even if you need it, then let's generate it
!<br /><br />What we've seen is that most of the time you start with an example, and here the example would be the code
you write all the day. Acceleo provides a specific tooling to help you<span style="font-weight: bold;"> starting a
	template from an example :</span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"
	href="https://literate.modeling.free.fr/modeling/acceleo/create-from-example-with-advanced-completion-1.htm"><img
		style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 322px;"
		src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/S0W5V3J-nMI/AAAAAAAAANY/_bf6auqtLPI/s400/initcompletion1.png" alt=""
		id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5423945111471824066" border="0" /></a>In this video you'll see the new template wizard with
the option to initialize it with an existing file content, then I'm leveraging the search &amp; replace smart completion
to quickly transform the example to a real template I can apply on a model (<span style="font-style: italic;">notice how
	the "for" closing brace completion auto-magically find a coherent place, it's using the text structure to do
	so</span>).<br /><br />In a few minutes you get a first working generation tailored to your specific needs. Of
course here it's Java but it might be <span style="font-weight: bold;">any language using any framework !
</span><br />As a sidenote the generation engine allows you to define protected areas in your template allowing you to
generate code you can then update by hand and then re-generate without loosing anything.<br /><span
