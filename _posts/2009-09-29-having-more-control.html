Who never asked for more time to focus on things that matters, like, for instance, <a
	href="https://mariot-thoughts.blogspot.com/2009/09/nathalie-effect-goals-tests-and-patches.html">gigantic
	barbecues</a> ?<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"
	href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SsIi1OL6w-I/AAAAAAAAALw/IpAvHoRsmME/s1600-h/100_9865.JPG"><img
		style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 273px;"
		src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SsIi1OL6w-I/AAAAAAAAALw/IpAvHoRsmME/s400/100_9865.JPG" alt=""
		id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5386906402025030626" border="0" /></a><br />And then you fulminate against this tool which
should help you and which is not,it's just another burden placed on you to provide this documentation nobody will ever
maintain or even read. I<span style="font-style: italic;">s that what modeling is about</span> ?<br /><br />Life as a
software user is often harsh, especially as you have, most of the time, no <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">control</span> at all on the software you use. As a developer it's even more difficult as
you have an idea on what's going on behind the scene, and not having control is something you just can't handle now that
so much open-source products are providing you this power.<br /><br />If you had control on your tools, if you could
adapt it or even easily define it, then you could focus on useful things. <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">Modeling</span> can bring it back to you, not modeling like in UML Modelers, modeling
like formalizing your domain model as a way to capture your though or your coding tasks.<br /><br />A Model doesn't have
to be high level, a model doesn't have to provide as much information as your source code, a model is just here to help
you answer questions about what you're doing.<br />If you can't say, for a given model what kind of questions it's
helping you to answer, then your model is just not relevant, it's not a model, let's call that <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">boxes with edges.</span><br /><br />And now let's take a small example, you wants to
define a software using components which are providing services, then you wants to assign these "logical" components to
Eclipse plugins, here is a model definition you can come up with :<br /><br /><a
	onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"
	href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SsIbD5F8ZMI/AAAAAAAAALQ/pHQPTzsglpQ/s1600-h/ecoremodel.png"><img
		style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 372px;"
		src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SsIbD5F8ZMI/AAAAAAAAALQ/pHQPTzsglpQ/s400/ecoremodel.png" alt=""
		id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5386897857967842498" border="0" /></a>From an instance of a model you can answer the
questions : how is split my application ? what services are provided and required by who ? And how these components are
linked to the Eclipse plugins I'm coding ?<br /><br />From now you can either capture an instance and start working
thanks from EMF Dynamic support , or specify a tooling to ease this capture. If a diagram is a good representation for
your problem, pick it, if it's not, pick a tabular, tree or even textual representation.<br /><br />The following demo
describe a tooling specification (click on the image! ) at the top, the specification, at the bottom, the tooling which
is dynamically adapting itself to the specification.<br /><br /><br /><a
	onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"
	href="https://literate.modeling.free.fr/modeling/designer/overview/OD-specifier.htm"><img
		style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 247px;"
		src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SsIxB3hUhoI/AAAAAAAAAMA/KUFbk1cSiG0/s400/specify.png" alt=""
		id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5386898630096669458" border="0" /></a><br />Modeling itself is useful to organize your
though, validate your design or even can help to pick the best trade-off for a given architecture. In a <a
	href="https://model-driven-blogging.blogspot.com/2009/05/viewpoints-enabled-modeling-tools.html">old post I was
	showing how a modeling tooling having support for viewpoints</a> is powerful in this regard. The next demo is
showing you how the developer or analyst, can then leverage the tooling definition (click again !) :<br /><a
	onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"
	href="https://literate.modeling.free.fr/modeling/designer/overview/OD-user.htm"><img
		style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 310px; height: 273px;"
		src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SsIxEy-DzDI/AAAAAAAAAMI/e1_RyvvdM6o/s400/use.png" alt=""
		id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5386899886600546674" border="0" /></a><br />Now you described everything and you're quite
happy with the result, why not using this information to help you produce code ? As soon as the modeling environment is
linked to the development tasks with code generators, the model is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not going to be
	deprecated</span>, it will be used by the team to get the <span style="font-weight: bold;">tedious</span> work
done.<br /><br />Moreover when the environment provides you navigation from your code to the model, then to the code,
and support for customizing anything in the generated code, then the tool is no more a burden, but a relief. (yet
another demo !)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"
	href="https://literate.modeling.free.fr/modeling/designer/overview/OD-Acceleo_Traceability.htm"><img
		style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 165px;"
		src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SsIw0a7QJ8I/AAAAAAAAAL4/AflscsX6aDU/s400/generate.png" alt=""
		id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5386900989701440706" border="0" /></a><br />It's been 3 years now since I arrived in <a
	href="https://www.obeosoft.com/fr/">Obeo</a>, and every tool we developed since then has been designed following
this motto : "Having more control, not getting in the way and providing value to the developer."<br /><br />So far I'm
quite happy with the results :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">ps : thanks to Jérôme who
