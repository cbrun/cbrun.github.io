excerpt: "Highlights from OCX 2024 in Mainz for Eclipse/open‑source and MBSE practitioners, with takeaways on Sirius Web, SysON, and the Cyber Resilience Act's impact."

I have just returned from the very first edition of **OCX, "Open Community Experience 2024"**, which was held in Mainz, Germany. Let me share this experience with you!

From the moment I arrived, I was struck by the vibrant atmosphere. After nearly 15 years of EclipseCon Europe in Ludwigsburg, this change of scenery was most welcome. Mainz, with its charm and energy, breathed new life into the event. As Mélanie put it, we were no longer stuck in the "Groundhog Day" from the movie. This new city offered us an ideal setting for exchange and collaboration, with comfortable spaces, tables, sofas, and snacks available at any time. The technical team did a remarkable job, providing production and recording worthy of the biggest events.

The welcoming and positive spirit of the Eclipse communities was palpable. Everywhere I looked, I saw smiling faces, lively discussions, and a shared passion for open-source innovation. We were not just participants but true actors and drivers of this dynamic ecosystem.

One of the most memorable experiences for me was the "silent disco" format. Imagine a room where four presentations are happening simultaneously, each person equipped with headphones and free to choose what they listen to. Initially, I was skeptical. How were we going to concentrate with so many stimuli around us? But as soon as the session began, I was won over. Being able to fully immerse oneself in a presentation while surrounded by other enthusiasts created a unique atmosphere. It was both fun and incredibly effective in promoting attention and engagement.

The Obeo team was on all fronts, with no less than five presentations on the program:

- **"Integrating React Flow in Sirius Web: Insights and Practical Lessons"** by Stéphane Bégaudeau. Stéphane plunged the audience into the heart of integrating React Flow into Sirius Web, demystifying technical complexities and sharing practical lessons.

- **"From Monolith to Modulith: The Evolution of Sirius Web's Architecture"** by Stéphane Bégaudeau and Mélanie Bats. Together, they explored the transformation from a monolithic architecture to a "modulith," addressing both technological and organizational challenges. Their holistic approach offered a fresh and relevant perspective on managing the evolution of software architectures.

- **"Open Innovation Unleashed: Obeo's Journey in the Open-Source Ecosystem"**, a presentation particularly close to my heart. I had the opportunity to revisit Obeo's 19-year journey in the open-source ecosystem. I shared our successes, our challenges, and how we've cultivated strong partnerships based on open innovation. It was motivating to see how much we've accomplished and to reflect on the positive externalities generated by our economic model.

- **"Building Graphical Web Applications: A Case Study on SysON"** by Axel Richard. Axel brilliantly demonstrated the power of Sirius Web by presenting web graphical tools that we can create today. His case study on SysON generated a lot of enthusiasm and questions from the audience.

- **Panel Discussion: "OCX Open Source Facing European Regulation: What's the Plan?"** in which I participated alongside other experts. The topic of the **Cyber Resilience Act** was central to the discussions. We explored its potential impact on IT SMEs and open-source communities. It was stimulating to see so many people committed to finding collaborative solutions to navigate this new regulatory landscape.

The **Cyber Resilience Act** is a major issue that cannot be ignored. As a forthcoming European regulation, it imposes new obligations regarding security, vulnerability management, and transparency for all companies providing software. For SMEs like Obeo, this represents a considerable challenge. The initial versions of the regulation threatened to have a negative impact on open-source communities. Fortunately, thanks to the collective efforts of various foundations, adjustments have been made to recognize the status of "open-source steward," thereby easing some constraints. However, the work is just beginning. At Obeo, we are determined to collaborate with the community to develop operating methods that meet these requirements while preserving the spirit of innovation.

In this spirit, we are actively participating in the **Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group**. This initiative is a tremendous opportunity to collectively shape the future of open-source software in terms of compliance, starting with the Cyber Resilience Act. Together, we can ensure that compliance standards remain accessible and adapted to the realities of SMEs and open-source projects.

Walking through the halls of OCX, I was also struck by the growing importance of open-source software in complex engineering sectors like automotive. The dynamism around the **Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle** community is a shining example. Seeing how traditional industries embrace open source to innovate and tackle technological challenges filled me with optimism. This reinforces our conviction at Obeo that open source is a powerful catalyst for progress.

Leaving Mainz, I feel invigorated and inspired. This first edition of OCX was more than just a conference. It was a celebration of collaboration, innovation, and the passion that drives our community. I am eager to see how the ideas and connections forged here will shape the next steps for Obeo and the open-source ecosystem.

A huge thank you to everyone who made this event possible. Your dedication and enthusiasm are the driving force that pushes us to go ever further. See you at the next edition in Brussels, to write together the next chapter of this exciting adventure!
