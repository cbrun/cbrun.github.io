The <b>indigo</b> release will be the first year the Eclipse Modeling package is no more marked as "incubating".  As I'm checking the status of every component I'm wondering : do you, <b>end users of the package, want an SDK package or not ? </b><div><div><br /></div><div>I, as of now, considered that using <i>EMF&amp;co</i> without the SDK was a real pain, but maybe I'm not the best representative and I'd like your feedback. Especially considering that now with the provisionning capabilities of Eclipse we also have a third option : transforming your non-SDK to an SDK package in one click.</div><div><br /></div><div>So here is the poll, it will stay online for one week and it needs like<b>, 2 secs, for you to fill :</b></div><div><br /></div><div><iframe src="https://spreadsheets.google.com/embeddedform?formkey=dGtJdmdWRkNYdmFrMkFITzh6eTZ1TEE6MQ" width="760" height="953" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe></div><div><br /></div><div>What are the implications ? Non-SDK package mean<b> smaller package</b> (around 100mo probably) or package with <b>more modeling tools</b>. On the other end SDK package means you can start using EMF&amp;co as frameworks right away.</div><div><br /></div><div>The poll will be on for a few days, go ahead and pick your choice !</div></div>
