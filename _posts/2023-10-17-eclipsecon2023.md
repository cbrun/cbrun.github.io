I am excited to announce our collaboration with CEA-List towards a new era of open-source model-based solutions!

We've embarked on three joint and complementary initiatives:
- *𝗣𝗮𝗽𝘆𝗿𝘂𝘀* adopting Sirius,
- developing Web Editors for Papyrus alongside the **𝗦𝗶𝗿𝗶𝘂𝘀 𝗪𝗲𝗯** platform,
- beginning the implementation of a Web-based version of the forthcoming systems engineering standard **𝗦𝘆𝘀𝗠𝗟 𝘃𝟮** through a project within the Eclipse Foundation named [𝗦𝘆𝘀𝗢𝗡](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-syson).

I had the pleasure to present all these initiatives at EclipseCon and at the Models 2023 - Industry Day, here are the slides:
