I have to admit I know nothing about soccer. Yes I'm a French guy, but I know nothing about soccer. That said I'm not against having a few beers in front of this broadcasted green field and I'm always in when it's about having fun with a small game leveraging Eclipse technologies.

Obviously I played with the EEF-based rich client for the forecasts, and from the moment the [source code has been made available](https://eef-modeling.blogspot.com/2010/06/eclipse-wordlcup-bye-bye-france-hello.html) I started hacking the code.

The forecasts, matchs and results are all kept in a model accessible through an http URI, and as _EMF rule them all, find them, bring them all and in the darkness bind them,_ you can leverage any Eclipse Modeling component to hack something quite easily.

That's what I did with Compare.

I extended the EMF editor adding a specific action, **"Compare with / Player with Best Rank"**.

This action allows you to compare your own forecasts with the best ones, and then merge your own forecast with the best player's one _(Noooo, that's not cheating!)_

And here is the user interface you get for free*, with a pure semantic comparison:

_\* you have to depend on EMF Compare though..._

Here is the logic needed to launch the comparison:

I had to use a few tricks: I had to provide a specific match engine enforcing the match of two players, otherwise the Compare component stops matching the forecasts from the beginning as the players are different.

That's all for today. If I can free more time for this hack I'll provide a diff extension to change the score delta representation to a more meaningful one â€” so far it's left as an exercise for the reader ;)
