I'm gonna miss the NoSQL / documentDB / graphDB revolution &nbsp;? I'm stuck with XML and POJO Java APIs from the previous decade ? My software will only be a single-user desktop application ? What about the cloud ?</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Stability</b>, <b>Predictability</b>, <b>Compatibility</b> are the key words explaining the success of EMF : others can innovate on top of it, on a solid base, bring it in another space and focus on the value. "Others" here are stands for the "EMF Ecosystem", frameworks, tools which agreed &nbsp;to access each others data reflectively, to refers to data using URIs&nbsp;by being built on top of EMF&nbsp;and then to provide even more services for the very same ecosystem.<br /><br />This leads to an innovative and versatile ecosystem, and that's what I'm going to talk about.</div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-y8xwV8h5G0s/UH6vkWyDQjI/AAAAAAAAD8w/_OLib2uUDBo/s1600/schedule.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="167" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-y8xwV8h5G0s/UH6vkWyDQjI/AAAAAAAAD8w/_OLib2uUDBo/s320/schedule.png" width="320" /></a></div>15 projects, from tools to work efficiently with Ecore to frameworks to build software applications. Some of them being a few classes, others a whole bunch of Jars, but each one useful in my opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp;During<b> 25 minutes, at EclipseCon Europe on Wednesday just before lunch.</b><br /><br />Technologies for NoSQL, document DB, concurrency, distributed architecture, crowdsourcing and much more, all of them on top of EMF.<br />More than just a list, for each of them an example of usage in a bigger application and my feedback using it.<br /><br />&nbsp;I can only say I already had a lot of fun preparing it and I can only hope you'll enjoy the talk.</div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
