When you pick technologies to build tools empowering hundreds of your engineers, you aim at making the best choice. Open-Source is the best when you play the long term.



The [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.dev/) ensures that all the metrics related to an Open-Source project are exposed on its 
website, helping you to assess the effort which goes into maintaining and updating the technology.



With **𝟭𝟮 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟮** : 📦 📦 📦 📦 📦 📦 📦 📦 📦 📦 📦 📦 , the [Eclipse Sirius](https://www.eclipse.dev/sirius/) project demonstrates its strength as a platform for building graphical modeling tools in any engineering domain. Each release brings a number of improvements and fixes to the core technology. **𝗜𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝟲 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗯𝗲𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗶𝗿𝗶𝘂𝘀 𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗱 𝗻𝗼 𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝟲𝟬 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀 !**



We are committed to maintain a similar pace for 2023. We are still at the beginning of the year and both Sirius and Sirius Web have already shipped one, enjoy!



Building graphical modeling tools can be a complex undertaking, especially if they need to support many features and functions. At Obeo, we have extensive experience in this area and strive to make the process as easy and accessible as possible. To accomplish this, we rely on several strategies, including modular design, higher-level abstractions, and the ability to iterate quickly on a tool definition. In the last few years we have kept these principles while transitionning the technologies to the Web.
