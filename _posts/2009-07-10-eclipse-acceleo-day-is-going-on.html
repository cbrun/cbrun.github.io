<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20090618_AcceleoDay.php">Eclipse Acceleo Day </a>started this morning. The event is collocated with the "<b>Libre Software Meeting</b>" at Nantes (France) . Yes, that's right ,we're part of this huge and lively movement which is <b>free software</b>.<div><br /></div><div>So far the even is going fairly well and many people from convinced users to modeling sceptical ones are attending. Getting feedback from the end user is <b>always valuable.</b></div><div><br /></div><div>I'll keep the Eclipse community in touch with what's going on here, thanks again to <a href="https://freddyallilaire.blogspot.com/">Freddy</a> who organized the event and to the foundation staff for their help !</div><div><br /></div>
