I was cleaning up my `${HOME}` folder today and found a set of demos I prepared two years ago.

I did this for a modeling course given at [Polytech'](https://www.polytech.univ-nantes.fr/). The course was about Model Driven Engineering; toward the end the students have to build a domain-specific model for textual adventure games and then generate the corresponding Java app. Some students tend to go very far on this exercise, building a fairly complex DSL.

The following demos are here to give an idea to the students of what can be done in a few minutes: a simple Ecore model

And then a graphical modeler:

And then we build Acceleo generator templates to directly map a game instance into its running Java code. It's a very interesting exercise; students stay focused because it's about a game, and at the same time it's a great example of the power of specific modeling. You don't design a game with a UML diagram, but building your own language and using it you're quickly getting results and can evaluate many designs.

Building the complete tooling is a matter of minutes, not hours. Here are the live demos:

- Designing the Domain Model: [video](https://ks360939.kimsufi.com/~cedric/data/AdventureGameEcore.htm)
- Specifying while running the Graphical Designer: [part1](https://ks360939.kimsufi.com/~cedric/data/GameModeler1.htm) and [part2](https://ks360939.kimsufi.com/~cedric/data/GameModeler2.htm)

As a sidenote, these flash demos are based on a pretty old version of Obeo Designer â€” if you're interested, have a look at the latest versions which are even better!
