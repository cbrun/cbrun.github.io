I'm now back to France after this great conference. Ed covered the "modeling events" quite well already but I can't prevent myself from sharing my pleasure as I'm still filled with excitement!

My overall impression of the conference is that it had many clear signs of an active, **innovative** and **enjoyable** community. No doubt E4 has its role in this whole "refreshment" thing; the debates in the symposium were more than interesting and I've no doubt such good and skilled people as those involved in E4 right now will come up with a great platform. In this regard, Tom's talks were more than interesting, keep doing the fun stuff!

The "**modeling is crap**" statement has been repeated quite a few times during the various talks. Ed described and analyzed such misconceptions â€” models will rule the world! Resistance is futile!

More seriously, I have the feeling the message "modeling is not UML" was really getting in. Thanks to Ecore and all the amazing projects under the Eclipse umbrella, you can define your own DSL and quickly develop your tooling or adapt existing tooling around that. That's being **agile**!

On the other side of the barrier, Eclipse is now able to compete with professional UML tools thanks to Papyrus (and on a sidenote EMF Compare ;) ). This quality of tooling was only available in commercial tools before, **things are changing**!

Speaking about EMF Compare, I was amazed to see how many people reused this project or integrated it in their own tooling. Getting this kind of feedback is not easy, especially with the newsgroup as you mostly only get the _"This stuff seems not to work"_ messages; ESE is a great place to meet your user base :)

Getting to ESE using the _"night train"_ was not the best way to rest, but the modeling symposium was perfectly handled by Markus and the tiredness quickly disappeared.

Then the talks took place. High quality ones for sure! It's a shame we have not been able to provide slots for the many other good talks submitted; let's hope we'll have more slots next year!

Summit also means socializing! Many _people_, many _beers_, good _food_, it can only lead to a nice reception :) I even hacked a bit with Sandro from the JCR management project which is really cool. How is it possible that all the guys working on models repositories are so friendly?

Then many more talks, chats, with many other Eclipse projects :) Time gets away too fast, and we were already having a last **modeling beer** at the Nestor hotel!

See you at EclipseCon!
