With Juno's arriving to the end of the release cycle, Eclipse Day's are popping up everywhere in the world.

If you are not too far from France, you should consider joining us next week for [Eclipse Day Toulouse](https://www.eclipsedaytoulouse.com/).

Great content, very low price (20€) and Toulouse is so sunny it can only be nice!

I will be there presenting Eclipse Modeling — a 101 session leading you to the jungle of one of the most diverse top level projects in Eclipse, describing some of the main components and how you can use them in your day to day work.

[Register now](https://www.eclipsedaytoulouse.com/en/registration/), this event takes place next week!

It is said the west of France is less sunny but I'm pretty sure its a myth spread by the Bretons frighten tourists. The [2012 breizhcamp](https://www.breizhcamp.org/) will be the occasion to confirm my belief.

This is a Java/Webapps event during two days with more than 50 speakers! I will be representing Eclipse there along with Stéphane. We will give an Acceleo tutorial.

And here is the Breizh Camp trailer:
