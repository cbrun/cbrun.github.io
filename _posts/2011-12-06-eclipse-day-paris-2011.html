Eclipse Con Europe. I had the chance to attend the 2011 edition and it was a <b>real pleasure</b> for several
reasons.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">1 - Organization
	rocked</span><br /><br />The event was perfectly organized. Proxiad and Zenika did a great job, timing was perfect
for the presentations, the content was interesting and the french touch for food and wine have been highly
appreciated&nbsp;!<br />

		imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213"
			src="{{ site.url }}/images/blog/2011/eclipse-day-paris-2011/IMG_1379%20(Custom).JPG"
			width="320" /></a></div><br /><a href="https://www.proxiad.com/">Proxiad</a> and <a
	href="https://www.zenika.com/">Zenika</a> are fairly original service providers : highly technical and active in
open source communities, it's always a pleasure to collaborate with them.&nbsp;<b>Congrats to the organizers
</b>!<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">2 - Diverse content</span><br /><br />The
talks were very diverse, from Ralph and the <b>Eclipse</b> <b>Foundation</b> to <b>UI testing</b> going through
<b>modeling</b>, <b>OSGi</b>, <b>Scout</b>, <b>BI</b> and<b> industrial feedback</b>. A nice
combination.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">3 - Wide and Diverse
	audience</span><br /><br />
<div style="text-align: right;"><a
		href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dnCvddjY6G8/TsrAjVp5s3I/AAAAAAAAAtI/z27QhXs4BBA/s800/IMG_1154+%2528Custom%2529.JPG"

<div style="text-align: left;">The event was free and attracted a<b> wide and diverse audience</b>. That was perfect for
	me as I was there as "Eclipse Modeling Evangelist", helping people understand what kind of technologies we are
	building in this project and how they could benefit from it with a very low cost or risk.</div><br /><a
	href="https://www.eclipsedayparis.com/2011/uploads/slides2011/CedricBrun_EclipseModeling.pdf">Slides (in english)
	are available here.</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a
	href="{{ site.url }}/images/blog/2011/eclipse-day-paris-2011/IMG_1164%20(Custom).JPG" imageanchor="1"
	style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213"
		src="{{ site.url }}/images/blog/2011/eclipse-day-paris-2011/IMG_1164%20(Custom).JPG"
		width="320" /></a><br />The room was crowded and actively listening. I had many interactions after the talk. The
Eclipse Modeling project is very hard to understand from the outside, it is <b>highly fragmented and poorly
	publicized</b>. I'll try to give more talks of this kind in the future.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span
	class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">4 - Hands on</span><br /><br />Afternoon we had an "hands on"
session with Obeo Designer, timing was short but all the attendees managed to build a DSL and a graphical modeler during
the session.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a
		href="{{ site.url }}/images/blog/2011/eclipse-day-paris-2011/IMG_1419%20(Custom).JPG"
		imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0"
			height="213"
			src="{{ site.url }}/images/blog/2011/eclipse-day-paris-2011/IMG_1419%20(Custom).JPG"
			width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />It's always <b>enlightening for us </b>to interact directly with users
trying the technology. It helps us identify very small things which are making a huge difference at the end. Obeo
Designer 6.0 will bring a lot of good stuff in this regard, stay tuned !<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In a
nutshell I really liked this event which is a<b> good complement </b>to other Eclipse events like democamps or eclipse
conferences. I'm looking forward to it for next year and can only advice you to book the dates !
