Witnessing an OSS technology getting together with a wide group of users is something I find exhilarating, I have experienced it with Acceleo, EMF Compare and Eclipse Sirius along the years, each time in different contexts and at different scales but discovering what is being done by others with a technology is always a source of excitement to me.

[Capella](https://mbse-capella.org/){:target="_blank"}  was contributed by Thales to the Eclipse communities a few years ago already and fueled by the growing need to design Systems in a better way, by the interest in Model Based System Engineering and the qualities of the product in itself we can clearly see an acceleration in the last few months.

If you are wondering what is Capella and what it's used for, here is a 2-minute video we prepared for you:

Worldwide awareness of this solution grows and adoption rises, organizations from Europe, North America and Asia are now using Capella and experiencing the benefits of using a tool which implements a method (coined "[Arcadia](https://mbse-capella.org/arcadia.html){:target="_blank"}") and **not only a language.**

Looking at the numbers, **just for this summer : more than 1200 downloads each month**, a forum actvity which has been growing with a nice looking curve and monthly stats on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfgwbb2h10V3tgJ59sbGBnQ/videos){:target="_blank"} reaching more than 2000 views: considering the size of the target audience this is a significant acceleration and that is without counting the deployment of [System Modeling Workbench](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/collaboration/product-architecture.html){:target="_blank"} provided by Siemens which includes the technology.

Adopters not only use it but speak about it and as with any other tool having an opportunity to understanding how others are using it is highly valuable.

Rolls Royce, ArianeGroup or the Singapore University: they all have shared valuable information through the recent webinars :
* [Introduction to Arcadia Capella with a toy catapult project](https://fr.slideshare.net/Obeo_corp/webinar-july-2019-introduction-to-capella-and-arcadia-with-a-simple-system){:target="_blank"}
* [Capella for large complex mechanical systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njW_zdE_FzI){:target="_blank"}
* MBSE must become a team sport !

More are coming and many already available through the [Resources Page](https://mbse-capella.org/resources.html){:target="_blank"}! BTW we can’t always get the authorization to keep them available online so your safest option is to register and attend.

We also make sure to setup « in Real Life » opportunities to discuss Capella and MBSE. Occasions to talk with the team behind Capella and the experts arounds the world. Next up is Capella Day Munich 2019 in a couple of weeks (the 16th of September) organized by Thales and Obeo in conjunction with the  [Models Conference 2019](https://modelsconf19.org/). Here is a glimpse of the program :

The agenda is filled with general presentations, feedback by industrial users about their Capella deployment or specific add-ons/integration.

**You might [want to hurry as we are almost sold out](https://polarsys.org/capella/capella_day_munich_2019.html){:target="_blank"} and such occasions are pretty unique!**

I sincerely hope you'll enjoy it, we are working hard to make it a success :-), if you can't make it this time then know there are more occasions to come: [AOSEC](https://www.incose.org/events-and-news/search-events/2019/10/17/default-calendar/asia-oceania-systems-engineering-conference-2019---call-for-papers){:target="_blank"} in Bangalore, EclipseCon in Germany (again!) where there might be a workshop focused on "MBSE at Eclipse" (Please add your name and interest on [the corresponding wiki page](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECE2019_MBSE_at_Eclipse){:target="_blank"} )
