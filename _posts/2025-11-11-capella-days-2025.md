excerpt: "Capella Days 2024 takeaways: MBSE creates value when models power operations; themes on shared infrastructure, accessibility, and governance—practical guidance for teams scaling Capella now."

Capella Days starts Tuesday 18 November (UTC+1). Reading the program, I see a community that is moving from “tool adoption” to “enterprise backbone.” Three signals stand out: deeper integrations, broader disciplines, and real outcomes at scale.

---

### Integrated and end to end

* Digital thread in practice, not slides. **KBR** shows hazards and safety requirements traced into BIM and design evidence.
* Sustainment is real. **Navantia** uses Capella with Teamcenter and Amesim for asset monitoring and availability prediction on the S80 submarines program.

### Tailorable, fast, and collaborative

* **Rivada Space Networks** illustrates an implementation-first approach for a fast LEO constellation, using Python4Capella and Property Values to align partners around the model as reference.
* **PGM** takes us from architecture to interfaces and cabling with a viewpoint covering buses, messages, signals, and preliminary cables.

### From mission to product lines

* **UNSW** with **Raytheon Australia** bridges Mission Engineering and system design using ARCADIA inside Capella so mission intent drives architecture.
* **MBDA** with **LGM** brings ISO 26580 PLE together with Capella and Pure::Variants to go from 150% to customer-ready 100% configurations.

### Safety and cybersecurity as continuous loops

* **BlueKei** integrates STPA early to derive safety requirements and cut late rework.
* **ReeR Safety** closes the loop after deployment with a Vulnerability Analysing Viewpoint tied to SBOM, CVE, and KEV, with impact overlays and risk matrices.

### Knowledge that travels

* **Siemens DISW** turns model content into consumable insights for non-SE stakeholders with an AI-assisted Knowledge Partner.
* **National Institude for Space Research** shares a reusable framework for ground segment architectures, validated on a real mission.
