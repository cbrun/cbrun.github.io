**Introducing Our Latest Innovations in Modeling: Eclipse Sirius & SysON**

This week, I presented at the Models 2024 conference in Linz (Austria) as part of the Industry Day, where I introduced two of our Open-Source initiatives: **Sirius Web**, part of the **Eclipse Sirius** project, and **Eclipse SysON**, a **SysMLv2** modeling tool built on Sirius.

During the session, I outlined several important aspects of our recent developments:

- **Eclipse Sirius: “Batteries Included”** – **Sirius Web** provides all the standard features you would expect from a comprehensive modeling tool, now available on the web for seamless collaboration and easy onboarding of users.
  
- **Combining Power and Flexibility** – Our approach is to leverage the strength of modeling while maintaining flexibility to ensure ease of adoption and a positive user experience.

- **Extensibility and Customization** –  The tool stack is fully extensible and customizable, making it ideal for building experimental prototypes that can scale up to industrial-grade solutions.

The feedback from the research community was encouraging, particularly regarding how these tools can be applied in fields like transportation, energy, space or even construction.

I’m also publishing the slides from my talk, along with video demonstrations, to provide more insight into the capabilities of **Sirius Web** and **SysON**. These tools offer organizations in various strategic domains a flexible, open-source solution to tackle complex systems.

Feel free to explore the slides below, and I look forward to your thoughts.
