At [work](https://www.obeosoft.com/fr/) we have a rule: if you commit something which does not compile, or that causes failure of the build, then you have to bring back a chocolates candies box.

Many “chocolate commits” happened lately and we manage to always get a candy for the coffee break. As I’m working on a quite tricky project I’m thinking ahead and I did prepare chocolates this morning.

The recipe is quite simple:

- dissolve/melt some chocolate
- wait a bit ’till it’s quite solid
- make tiny balls with the chocolate
- roll them in sugar
- roll them in hot really black chocolate
- roll them in cacao powder
- wait a bit ’till it’s totally solid
- commit something using `String.isEmpty` for instance, be sure someone notices the mistake fast
- bring the chocolates!
