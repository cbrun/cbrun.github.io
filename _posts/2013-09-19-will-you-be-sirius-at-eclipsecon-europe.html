We've been in some sort of <i>"Stealth mode"</i> since the proposal for Eclipse Sirius got accepted. It did not makes
sense to us to communicate on Sirius as long as it's not there, in Eclipse. That said, the summer actually was quite
intense, I'll start by a quick status report :<br /><br />Pierre-Charles worked on preparing the move to the Eclipse
infrastructure and the Foundation IP Team reviewed the code. We just got the green light from Sharon (kudos to her!) and
the code was commited by Stéphane Bonnet (Thales) two weeks ago . The code is now hosted on <a
	href="https://git.eclipse.org/c/sirius/org.eclipse.sirius.git/">git.eclipse.org</a>. <a
	href="https://hudson.eclipse.org/sirius/">Continuous integration</a> and <a
	href="https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/org.eclipse.sirius,n,z">gerrit</a> are operationals though builds are not
published on Eclipse.org yet.<br /><br />Right now the team is &nbsp;working on 6 different streams to prepare for
upcoming releases, notably Obeo Designer 6.2 and service releases for Obeo Designer 6.1 and 6.0. The team will
progressively ramp up on the Eclipse.org infrastructure as our 6 different streams are delivered.<br /><br />We are also
taking the opportunity of this big namespace change to clean-up some long deprecated APIs and to rethink the way Sirius
is modularized. See the <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Sirius/Modularization">wiki for more details</a> but in the
end, the APIs we are publishing right now will probably move quite a lot until the 1.0 release.&nbsp;We are soon going
to <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.sirius">draft the plan </a>for the 0.9 and 1.0 releases and
officially announce our participation to Eclipse Luna.<br /><br />In the meantime the Obeo Marketing and Communication
team is working on giving the project a visual identity. I can't wait for it!<br /><br />In a nutshell, <b>everything
	will be ready for EclipseCon Europe</b>, we'll have RC quality builds of Sirius 0.9 by then, a website, more content
on the wiki, published downloads, Obeo and Thales will be actively working on the Eclipse git repository and
bugzilla.<br />

<br />You'll get to see the Sirius in action during EclipseCon Europe, we worked on a few cool talks for you
:<br /><br /><a href="https://cedric.brun.io/images/blog/2013/Arduino_Uno_Angle.jpg" imageanchor="1"

		src="https://cedric.brun.io/images/blog/2013/Arduino_Uno_Angle.jpg" width="200" /></a>It will
start on Tuesday at 15:00, right after the keynote. Mélanie will &nbsp;<b>turn Eclipse into an Arduino Programming
	platform for kid</b>s, providing a visual programming environment not unlike <a
	href="https://blog.ardublock.com/">Ardublock</a> (you bet, based on Sirius). How can we tweak the Eclipse user
experience so that even kids can use it ?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

			width="320" /></a></div>On Wednesday at 14:30, <b>Sirius, Changing the Game of Systems Architecture</b>, a
sponsored talk presented by Etienne and Frederic in which you'll get to learn about a collection of Sirius case studies
from a space agency to an insurance company and for each of them how Eclipse Modeling - and Sirius - have been
effectively combined.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

			width="320" /></a></div>At 16h15 Stéphane Bonnet (Thales) and Pierre-Charles will present <b>Sirius By
	Example : Build Your Own Diagram, Table and Tree Editors in 20 minutes</b>. This talk will give an overview of the
main Sirius features, and show how to use it to create custom tooling around a given technology. You will also learn
about the origin and history of Sirius and how it has been deployed in operational and intensive contexts within Thales.
It was given at EclipseCon France, the room was packed and we had a very good feedback about
it.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Right after this talk, at 17:00, I will present <b>EcoreTools 2.0 : The Making-Of</b>&nbsp;or
<i>"How to transform a GMF based modeler to a Sirius based one".</i> You will discover how I used Sirius's features -
some of them quite advanced - to re-design the user experience of
EcoreTools.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Then the team will gather for a <b>Sirius BOF</b> (to be announced)
. You get to ask any question about Sirius and we will be glad to coach you in getting started with the
technology.<br /><br />

come by to ask questions or even just to have a chat. We are always eager to learn about use cases or
experiments.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm looking forward to it. If you're interested
in modeling and did not register for EclipseCon Europe yet, <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2013/">consider
	doing it,</a> I guarantee you'll learn a lot !<br /><br /><br />
