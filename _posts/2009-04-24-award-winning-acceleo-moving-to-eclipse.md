Thank you from the **Acceleo Team** _(unfortunately not complete here, have a look on the team pages for [core](https://www.acceleo.org/pages/contacts) and [modules](https://www.acceleo.org/pages/contacts-des-modules/))_!

Thanks to all the people involved in Acceleo's winning the "[_Best Open Source_ Eclipse-Based Developer Tool](https://www.eclipse.dev/org/foundation/eclipseawards/index.php)" prize this year. No doubt you'll be quite pleased to hear that **Next-gen Acceleo development is taking place in Eclipse.org**, [right there](https://www.eclipse.dev/modeling/m2t/?project=acceleo#acceleo), in the M2T project.

The next-gen Acceleo has many differences with the Acceleo.org one, especially:

- efficient **standalone** support right now; reuse the generation engine even outside of an Eclipse or OSGi context — just put the EMF and OCL jars and you're done.
- a new **statically typed** syntax based on the MTL OMG standard
- **aspect-like patterns** to extend existing cartridges
- automatically generated **Java API** for your generation module; easily leverage a generation cartridge from your own action or wizard.

But we keep the fundamentals that made Acceleo.org a success, especially:

- **Pragmatic vision**: make it easy for the 95% stuff everybody does; put Java extensions for the remaining 5%.
- **Nifty tooling**: debug, completion, show references, open declaration, highlighting, markers — the features you expect from an Eclipse editor are there.
- **Community**: the Acceleo.org community provided a full set of ready-to-use cartridges (JEE, PHP, C, Python, C#...). No doubt this community will follow the project on Eclipse and expects nice pragmatic generators. [EEF](https://www.eclipse.dev/proposals/eef/) is opening the path.
