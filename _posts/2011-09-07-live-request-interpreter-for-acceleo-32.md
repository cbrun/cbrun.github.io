[Laurent](https://eclipsemde.blogspot.com/) is working on an **Interpreter View** for Acceleo 3.2 (coming soon).

It feels good already: one can launch queries on any Editor or View, syntax highlighting works and so do completion proposals. Compilation errors are shown too.

It's the perfect companion for building your code generator â€” once you start using it you will wonder how you could live without it before.

By the way, [Laurent](https://eclipsemde.blogspot.com/) is going to give more detail about it quite soon..
