My last post about the flow model simulation was really missing a demo so that you get the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> "live" </span>aspect of the model construction. No problem, that's a good occasion to show you a secret product we've been building on<span style="font-weight: bold;"> top of the Eclipse Modeling projects</span> since a few year now.  In my <a href="https://model-driven-blogging.blogspot.com/2009/02/engineering-dictator-strikes-back.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">dictator</span> position</a> on this product you can guess I'm quite excited to show you that, <span style="font-weight: bold;">nothing public came out about it since now</span> but the first public release is not so far...<br /><br />Let's stop the teasing and watch the content,  here are a few flash demos . If you're just interested in the resulting modeler, go directly to the last one showing the live model design. If you don't understand what's about that<span style="font-style: italic;"> flow </span>stuff or if you're wondering how all that <span style="font-style: italic;">load</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">capacities</span> properties gets updated, have a look <a href="https://model-driven-blogging.blogspot.com/2009/05/live-models-using-jboss-rules-drools.html">on my preceding post.</a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://literate.modeling.free.fr/modeling/designer/SpecifyModeler.htm"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 201px;" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SgsLjej2tHI/AAAAAAAAAJI/aKswPsPwwHM/s400/flowdiag_specify.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5335370887677260914" border="0" /></a><br />The first demos are showing the graphical modeler construction. In a few clicks, just defining the concepts you want to display, how you want to display them and how to retrieve them in the semantic model. You get your modeler in a matter of minutes, and you really should not need more than that as it's quite simple.<br /><br />I really like the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"specifying the modeler and using it side by side"</span> feature even if you need a big display for that and here for the demo I have no choice than scrolling.<br /><br />The next demo is focused on defining<span style="font-style: italic;"> "conditional styles"</span> so that the graphical shapes changes depending on the changes in the semantic model (node/edge sizes and colors), in this demo I also specify the fact that a <span style="font-style: italic;">CompositeProcessor </span>reuse the graphical mappings define for the diagram and that I should be able to create a sub diagram on a<span style="font-style: italic;"> CompositeProcessor.</span><br />The request langage I'm using is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Acceleo</span>, but you could also use <span style="font-weight: bold;">OCL</span>, I tend to prefer simplicity ;)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://literate.modeling.free.fr/modeling/designer/CustomizeModeler.htm"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 293px;" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SgsITi7AfhI/AAAAAAAAAJA/THMCeWSDCes/s400/flowdiag_customize.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5335367315435322898" border="0" /></a><br />And at last, after a bit more tweaking  off stage, the usage of this finished <span style="font-weight: bold;">dynamic modeler</span>.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://literate.modeling.free.fr/modeling/designer/UsingModeler.htm"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 163px;" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SgsOObST5hI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/WKuM4Re4jt8/s400/flowdiag_usage.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5335373824556000786" border="0" /></a><br /><br />So, <span style="font-weight: bold;">to be fair</span>, the final modeler is more a 25 minute modeler than 20, but that said, I get a first working modeler a the minute 10 of the first demo.<br /><br />Be sure that's only a tiny portion of what we've been able to achieve leveraging the Eclipse Modeling components (<a href="https://www.eclipse.dev/modeling/">EMF, GMF,</a> <a href="https://www.acceleo.org">Acceleo, </a><a href="https://www.eclipse.dev/modeling/emft/?project=compare#compare">Compare</a> just naming a few...) and the Eclipse Platform :  graphic modeler are one thing, but other representation matters and I'm not even speaking about the "<span style="font-style: italic;">full viewpoint suppor</span>t".<br /><br />Stay tuned for more eye candy ;)
