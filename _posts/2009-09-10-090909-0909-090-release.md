Laurent did it not even on purpose, but the latest Acceleo I-build, which is the 0.9 branch, performed well and has this **golden qualifier**:

So if you're superstitious or a numerology believer, don't miss such a release!

As a sidenote, the Acceleo Team will be at ESE with the talk: "[From Acceleo.org to Eclipse.org](https://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2009/sessions?id=971)" and the EEF project, first consumer in Eclipse of the Acceleo Technology, will present: "[EEF you want sexy properties ...](https://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2009/sessions?id=946)"

If you're interested in the model power, EMF goodness, modeling environments, viewpoints based modeling and/or the Eclipse platform in general, let's meet in [Ludwigsburg!](https://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2009/)
