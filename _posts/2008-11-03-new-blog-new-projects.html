I did not blogged a lot lately, several reasons for that:<br /><ol><li>my web hoster decided that I had too much spam on my blog and <span style="font-weight: bold;">destroyed </span>the whole website with all its content :S</li><li>I had a few weeks of vacation, a good chance to rest you'll say ! Well.. not really as you'll see with point 3 and 4 ;)</li><li>in order to compete with Ed's incredible garden we decided to bought a house, so expect many more <span style="font-weight: bold;">metaphoric blog posts </span>with home made pictures!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SQ83MaH5wxI/AAAAAAAAAAM/7U5ADFXexlg/s1600-h/house_garden.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 214px;" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SQ83MaH5wxI/AAAAAAAAAAM/7U5ADFXexlg/s320/house_garden.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264487175729824530" border="0" /></a></li><li>And at last but not least : <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gaspard</span> (Casper in English) joined us after 9 months of ecstatic waiting<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OJuY9x1lbxI/SOMKDUu-g0I/AAAAAAAAAHg/WjR-KlM35oU/s1600-h/Gaspard2_30092008_light.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OJuY9x1lbxI/SOMKDUu-g0I/AAAAAAAAAHg/WjR-KlM35oU/s400/Gaspard2_30092008_light.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5252052642665759554" border="0" /></a></li></ol><br />That makes many good reasons to justify my lack of <span style="font-style: italic;">"mail answering"</span> the previous weeks don't you think ? :)<br />Now let's work on those mails and prepare this <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2008/">great incoming Eclipse conference</a> !<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;font-family:verdana;" >(The title is a quote by Don Herold)</span>
