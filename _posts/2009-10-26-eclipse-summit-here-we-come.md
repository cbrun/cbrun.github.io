I'm polishing and putting the last touches of goodness in my slides for Eclipse Summit Europe. I'm looking forward to a great event as usual, with this warm and fuzzy feeling you have realizing you're part of such a vibrant community.

If you are wondering how **"we"** — the Acceleo project — became **"we"** the Eclipse Project, do not miss my talk:

ESE, even more than EclipseCon, is a nice moment to learn more about all the technologies available at Eclipse and to exchange with the teams behind those. I'm going to catch you: "[projects](https://www.eclipse.dev/ecf/) [I'm](https://www.eclipse.dev/projects/project_summary.php?projectid=technology.jwt) [particularly](https://www.eclipse.dev/equinox/) [interested](https://www.eclipse.dev/projects/project_summary.php?projectid=technology.egit) [about](https://eclipse.org/rap/)", and ask you questions — even dumb ones! Please take this chance to do the same about the Eclipse Modeling project!
