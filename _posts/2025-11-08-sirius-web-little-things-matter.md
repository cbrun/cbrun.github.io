At Obeo we push modeling hard, but adoption is won by the experience. The little things matter. Subtle behaviors that add up across selection, navigation, editing, placement, and link routing. That is why in our 8-week iterations you will always see many small, targeted improvements. August and October are good examples.



From 2025.10 specifically:


* Highest commit count so far, focused on polish and predictability.
* **Edge styles in the view DSL** with three options: Manhattan, SmartManhattan, and Oblique.
* **Appearance customization** extended to edges and all remaining node types, with extension points for custom node appearance.
* **Labels that behave.** Move edge and external node labels directly on the diagram, or hide them. A pin option is planned to lock positions.
* **Drop feedback that matches your intent.** New nodes land centered under the cursor for precise placement.
* **Selection rework.** You choose how linked views behave. The Details view can stay synced with the last selection or remain independent. You can also push a selected element from one view to another when you need it.
* **Workbench views.** Display multiple views at once in the left or right panels to compare, cross-reference, and stay in flow.


This is exactly the kind of incremental refinement we aim for: fewer surprises, clearer feedback, faster moves. And we are not done. More of these quality-of-life upgrades are coming in **2025.12**.
