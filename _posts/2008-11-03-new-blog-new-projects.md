I did not blog a lot lately, several reasons for that:

1. my web host decided that I had too much spam on my blog and **destroyed** the whole website with all its content :S
2. I had a few weeks of vacation, a good chance to rest you'll say! Wellâ€¦ not really as you'll see with point 3 and 4 ;)
3. in order to compete with Ed's incredible garden we decided to buy a house, so expect many more **metaphoric blog posts** with home made pictures!

4. And last but not least: **Gaspard** (Casper in English) joined us after 9 months of ecstatic waiting

That makes many good reasons to justify my lack of _"mail answering"_ the previous weeks don't you think? :)

Now let's work on those mails and prepare this [great incoming Eclipse conference](https://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2008/)!
