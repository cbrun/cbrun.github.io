<br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Community and Ecosystem</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><br />The Juno release cycle has been very interesting for EMF Compare - <b>as a project</b>.<br /><br />Discussions started through the &nbsp;Modeling Platform working group lead to the <b>sponsorship</b> of a bunch of new features (<i>we covered those before but in a nutshell : &nbsp;UML dedicated support, UI enhancements, Graphical comparison support and Logical Model for EGit).&nbsp;</i><br /><br />Meanwhile we took a number of actions to make this project a <b>more welcoming area</b> for contributions and to ease adoption, some of these actions are technical (documentation, build, tests and continuous integration) and others are focused on community grow (transparency, communication, <a href="https://www.iwmcp.org/2011/">discussions with academic researchers</a>).<br /><br />We <b>are not done yet </b>and have several remaining actions but we can already see some results :<br /><br />-<b> new adopters</b> appeared and contacted us through the bugzilla with use cases we had not envisionned, trying to keep the answering delay reasonable helped a lot in converging to a patch. Within Eclipse itself we've seen several new projects adopting the technology.<br />-<b> new features contribution</b> : &nbsp;thanks to Arthur from Atos a <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=360757">dedicated support for SysML</a> model just got integrated and is now built. In those cases where timeframe is obviously bigger than a simple patch, git helps a lot.<br />- discussions with academics helped us drafting<b> powerful new features </b>for 2.0 like fingerprints based matching (<i>a complete blog post about this will come soon</i>)<br /><br />EclipseCon US will be a great place to share our experience, I if you're interested or would like to see a specific topic within this scope,<a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/models-and-scm-eclipse-bright-future"> feel free to add a comment.</a><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">More about SysML ...</span><br /><br />The SysML contribution is built on top of the UML dedicated support, it just got integrated and built.<br />It never got released so it might be a bit rough, and we still have some issues we<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=365285"> want to fix for 1.3</a> but if you feel adventurous, <a href="https://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/compare/updates/interim/1.3/">go get the bits here </a>!<i>(update site)</i>
