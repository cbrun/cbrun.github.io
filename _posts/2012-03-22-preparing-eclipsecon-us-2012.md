We are pretty active in Eclipse:

- building the technology to [generate code or text from models](https://www.eclipse.dev/acceleo)
- lowering the ["system" versus "doc" barrier](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Intent)
- providing a cool UI generation technology to [pimp your editors](https://www.eclipse.dev/modeling/emft/?project=eef)
- enabling [model to model transformations](https://www.eclipse.dev/atl/)
- building the [Modeling package](https://www.eclipse.dev/modeling/amalgam/)
- enabling [team work on models](https://www.eclipse.dev/emf/compare/) using your favorite SCM
- making sure graphical Ecore modeling is [still a reality](https://twitter.com/#!/bruncedric/status/169342129745829889) (HELP WELCOME)
- [mentoring](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Architecture_Council) new projects
- reporting and fixing bugs on several [other](https://www.eclipse.dev/cdo/) [projects](https://www.eclipse.dev/modeling/gmp/?project=gmf-runtime#gmf-runtime).
- [organizing](https://www.acceleo.org/wiki/index.php/Eclipse_Acceleo_Day) or [sponsoring](https://www.eclipsedayparis.com/) Eclipse related events

I'd love to show all these things during EclipseCon, especially considering things are happening for every single project listed here(*). There is just not enough time and many other interesting things to cover in such a short event but feel free to come and talk to us during the conference. On the other hand we are giving several talks worth mentioning:

You didn't know Acceleo was an implementation of an OMG standard? Stéphane will present it during the Eclipse/OMG Workshop on Sunday.

Meet Stéphane on Sunday, 15:55 – 16:20.

Eclipse is a best platform to build tools. Eclipse Modeling makes things even easier — but why would you need tools? Aren't they available already? Well, generic tools suitable for any use case are hard to make; you might want to use a given technology and not have any tool. Good news is Eclipse Modeling enables you to build a dedicated tool in no time. We'll start the EclipseCon conference with a tutorial so that you learn how, leading you through an example tool to build a web app powered by localstorage, Backbone.js and jQuery.

We're preparing the tutorial content in a way that you should be able to replay or present it when you're back home. All the steps are documented through eclipse cheatsheets and you'll get an all-in-one update-site.

Meet Stéphane and me on Monday, 13:00 – 16:00 in Lake Anne B.

If you're interested in industrial collaboration to provide long term and very long term support for Eclipse technologies, [the Polarsys talk on Tuesday is for you.](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/how-polarsys-addresses-long-term-support-and-develops-ecosystem-eclipse-tools-critical-embe)

Meet Gael on Tuesday, 17:00 – 17:50 in Reston Suites B.

If you're more interested in technologies, modularity and dynamicity, Mikael is sharing an experiment on bringing EMF in a multi-tenant and dynamic world while trying to reduce API breakages to a minimum: [3MF : EMF To the infinity ... and beyond !](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/3mf-emf-infinity-and-beyond)

Meet Mikael on Tuesday, 17:00 – 17:50 in Lake Thoreau.

If you're into Agile and ALM and don't want to give up on design documentation, Alex will present the Mylyn Intent project:

![Intent ALM]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/2012/preparing-eclipsecon-us-2012/s400_IntentALM_v1.0.0.png)

Meet Alex on Wednesday, 10:30 – 11:15 in Regency Ballroom A.

In a nutshell, it's gonna be legendary :)

(*) I guess I should also blog more to share what's happening.
