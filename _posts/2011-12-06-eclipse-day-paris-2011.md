Eclipse Day Paris took place a few weeks ago; every year it is scheduled the week after Eclipse Con Europe. I had the chance to attend the 2011 edition and it was a **real pleasure** for several reasons.

1 - Organization rocked

The event was perfectly organized. Proxiad and Zenika did a great job, timing was perfect for the presentations, the content was interesting and the french touch for food and wine have been highly appreciated!

[Proxiad](https://www.proxiad.com/) and [Zenika](https://www.zenika.com/) are fairly original service providers: highly technical and active in open source communities. It's always a pleasure to collaborate with them. **Congrats to the organizers!**

2 - Diverse content

The talks were very diverse, from Ralph and the **Eclipse Foundation** to **UI testing** going through **modeling**, **OSGi**, **Scout**, **BI** and **industrial feedback**. A nice combination.

3 - Wide and Diverse audience

The event was free and attracted a **wide and diverse audience**. That was perfect for me as I was there as "Eclipse Modeling Evangelist", helping people understand what kind of technologies we are building in this project and how they could benefit from it with a very low cost or risk. [Slides (in english) are available here.](https://www.eclipsedayparis.com/2011/uploads/slides2011/CedricBrun_EclipseModeling.pdf)

The room was crowded and actively listening. I had many interactions after the talk. The Eclipse Modeling project is very hard to understand from the outside — it is highly fragmented and poorly publicized. I'll try to give more talks of this kind in the future.

4 - Hands on

Afternoon we had a "hands on" session with Obeo Designer. Timing was short but all the attendees managed to build a DSL and a graphical modeler during the session.

It's always enlightening for us to interact directly with users trying the technology. It helps us identify very small things which make a huge difference at the end. Obeo Designer 6.0 will bring a lot of good stuff in this regard — stay tuned!

In a nutshell I really liked this event which is a **good complement** to other Eclipse events like democamps or Eclipse conferences. I'm looking forward to it for next year and can only advise you to book the dates!
