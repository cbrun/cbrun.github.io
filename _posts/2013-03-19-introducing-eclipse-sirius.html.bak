You might have noticed some signs of excitement from us lately, one being the following tweet :<br /><br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="fr">4:45 pm : I'm clicking on "send" and it's gonna rock.<br />— Cédric Brun
	(@bruncedric) <a href="https://twitter.com/bruncedric/status/309331351579009024">6 mars 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> <br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>What was sent at 4:45pm? a<a
	href="https://www.eclipse.dev/proposals/modeling.sirius/"> new project proposal</a> for Eclipse, one which, in my
opinion, is a major event.<br /><br />Let me introduce you to <b>Eclipse Sirius</b> !<br /><br />Have you ever wanted a
nice graphical environment customized for your domain data but been discouraged by the complexity of all the
technologies needed to create one? Maybe you compromised and decided to use an existing format or notation, even if it
does not completely fit your needs, just to benefit from the associated tools. Fear no more! Instead of adapting your
needs to some existing tool, with Sirius the tooling adapts itself to you, as it should be. And you don't even need to
learn about the Eclipse Modeling stack, we did it for you.<br /><br /><i>That said, if you want to tweak something you
	can always plug your customization in through the underlying frameworks, namely : GMF, GEF, EMF and the Eclipse
	Platform.</i><br /><br /><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">How did it all
	start ?</span><br /><br />It's no vaporware. We started the development of Sirius a few years ago with Thales. We've
set-up together a great team to build this technology, known as Doremi at that time.<br /><br /><br />Thanks to this
collaboration, we've reached a very high <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Readiness_Level">level of
	maturity</a>: Sirius is used in many very large projects within Thales and it's been around in Obeo Designer for a
few years already. It is also the foundation of several tools you can already find in the Eclipse Marketplace,&nbsp;<a
	href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/database-designer-indigo-version#.UUc2InFHq2A">some</a> <a
	href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/graal-designer-indigo-version#.UUc2J3FHq2A">of</a> <a
	href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/risk-analysis-designer-helios-version#.UUc2M3FHq2A">them</a> being
installed by more than<a href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/node/622477"> 2000 users a month.</a><br /><br /><br />We
are not kidding.<br /><br />This contribution to Eclipse means a whole new team will become commiters. They have been
working on Sirius for years and you already know them as contributors. You will now see those guys from Thales and Obeo
co-leading and working in the open.<br /><br /><b>What about Obeo Designer ?</b><br /><br />Sirius is one Obeo
Designer's components. Once published via Eclipse the Sirius open source version will be included in Obeo
Designer.<br /><br />Sirius being open-source doesn't change much besides strengthening Obeo Designer by significantly
growing the user base of one of its components. This means more diverse usages, more tests "in the wild" and potentially
more designers to reuse or extend.<br /><br />Obeo Designer remains a commercial product : a strong and open platform to
build and deploy your modeling environment with well integrated and tested components. It is the perfect companion for
professional usage by bringing collaborative modeling and support.<br /><br /><b>Why ?</b><br /><br />First because it
is in our DNA, we strive to build great products in the open. And our partners are supporting us on this, especially
Thales, since Sirius is the result of many years of a joint and rich collaboration with Obeo.<br /><br />Secondly to
unleash the energies in Eclipse Modeling. There is a lot of interest in this domain, &nbsp;companies are in dire need of
solutions but the cost to fill the gap between what they need and what Eclipse Modeling provides right now is too high.
We are reducing this gap with Sirius and this will trigger more usage and more funding for Eclipse Modeling as a
whole.<br /><br />We also want to work with you, fellow commiters and OSS tool providers, in building the best tools
ever. We are building a great component, but having a non open-source runtime may slow down its adoption. This last
barrier is now gone.<br /><br /><b>Have some questions ?</b><br />I'm sure you have tons of them. Please use the <a

	forum.</a><br /><br /><b>Want to know more ?</b><br /><br />

week<a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/2013/sessions/your-custom-modeling-environment-definition-made-easy-last">. At
	1:30 pm On Tuesday</a>&nbsp;.<br /><br />I'll present the project with Stephane Bonnet from Thales in the session
:<br /><br /><b><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">"Your custom modeling environment definition made
		easy. At last !"</span></b><br /><br />During this session you'll learn about the project, its goals, its
current deployments and you'll see it in action with live demos.<br /><br />I will also introduce the project during the
<a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/2013/sessions/modelling-symposium">Modeling Symposium</a> later the same day
!<br /><br />Sirius brings you the ability to quickly define your dedicated editors : diagram, tree, tables, it would be
a shame not to show you what you can do with it :<br /><br /><a
