You're a computer science or engineering student, you love open source and would like to be involved in one of the greatest OSS projects of all time?

![Google Summer of Code]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/2010/soc.png)

You're lucky, the Google Summer of Code 2010 is starting and is a perfect moment to join the Eclipse community.

If you're a committer you can throw your idea on the [wiki page](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2010_Ideas); if you're a student, contact the development team or provide your own ideas.

I provided a few ideas; here are those that got most of the votes at Obeo:

- **EMF Shell**: This one is geekish — providing an environment with "shell-like" commands to manipulate models. One would expect `wc` to count model elements, `grep` to filter model elements, `cd` to move within models, `ls`, `sed` to substitute, and all the other commands which could be useful in this context. Haven't you ever dreamed to filter the opened view of your e4-modeled workbench using `grep`?

Now that SWT-QT [seems to be a reality](https://www.compeople.eu/blog/?cat=4), I can't prevent myself from dreaming about a GEF port on QT. QT has amazing graphical capabilities and provides the best performance on every platform around. GEF is great, but is it ready for next-gen graphical modelers?

Go and have [a look at the demos](https://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/examples.html). That could be a game-changer for graphical modeling — let's call it **CuteGEF** :)

Of course modeling in general, **EMF Compare** and **Amalgam** topics are on [the wiki page](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2010_Ideas); you have plenty of subjects to choose from!

Please, if you're a student and are interested in participating in the GSOC, do not wait! Work with the projects to prepare your application!
