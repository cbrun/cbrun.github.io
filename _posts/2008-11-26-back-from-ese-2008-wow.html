I'm now back to France after this great conference.  Ed covered the "modeling events" quite well already but I can't prevent myself from sharing my pleasure as I'm still filled with excitement !<br /><br />My overall impression on  the conference is that it had many clear signs of an active, <span style="font-weight: bold;">innovative</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">enjoying</span> community. No doubt E4 has its role in this whole "refreshment" thing, the debates in the symposium were  more than interesting and I've no doubt such good and skilled people as those involved in E4 right now will come up with a great platform. In this regard, Tom's talks were more than interesting, keeps doing the fun stuffs !<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw6WEWQHwI/AAAAAAAAACw/j66TGszx0ZE/s1600-h/Tomstalk.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw6WEWQHwI/AAAAAAAAACw/j66TGszx0ZE/s320/Tomstalk.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272653414542614274" border="0" /></a><br />The  "<span style="font-weight: bold;">modeling is crap"</span>  statement has been repeated  quite a few times during the various talks,  Ed described and analysed such misconceptions, models will rules the world ! Resistance is futile !<br />More seriously, I have the feeling the message "modeling is not UML" was really getting in, thanks to Ecore and all the amazing projects under the Eclipse umbrella, you can define your own DSL and quickly develop your tooling or adapt existing tooling around that. That's being <span style="font-weight: bold;">agile </span>!<br /><br />On the other side of the barrier, Eclipse is now able to compete with profesionnal UML tools thanks to Papyrus (and one a sidenote EMF Compare ;) ) This quality of tooling was only available in commercial tools before, <span style="font-weight: bold;">things are changing</span> !<br /><br />Speaking about EMF Compare, I was amazed to see how many people reused this project or integrated it in their own tooling. Getting this kind of feedback is not easy, especially with the newsgroup as you mostly only get the <span style="font-style: italic;">"This stuff seems not to work"  </span>messages, ESE is a great place to meet your user base :)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSwy-10O2-I/AAAAAAAAABQ/jpE8HtATnew/s1600-h/Josleeping_1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSwy-10O2-I/AAAAAAAAABQ/jpE8HtATnew/s320/Josleeping_1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272645318923443170" border="0" /></a><br />Getting to ESE using the <span style="font-style: italic;">"night train" </span>was not the best way to rest, but the modeling symposium was perfectly handed by Markus and the tiredness quickly disappeared.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw0wGO8q8I/AAAAAAAAACA/Ie3LLAang6E/s1600-h/symposium_1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 214px;" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw0wGO8q8I/AAAAAAAAACA/Ie3LLAang6E/s320/symposium_1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272647264655682498" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Then the talks took place. High quality ones for sure ! That's a shame we have not been able to provide slots for the many good other talk submitted, let's hope we'll have more slots next year !<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSwzWfQ8-FI/AAAAAAAAABg/2_qD0BqBiaY/s1600-h/img_4004_1.jpg"></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSwzePyctrI/AAAAAAAAABo/vLS7tDuWNxU/s1600-h/img_4017_1.jpg"></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw1zTptyHI/AAAAAAAAACI/HyIsHXEennU/s1600-h/talksban.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 146px;" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw1zTptyHI/AAAAAAAAACI/HyIsHXEennU/s400/talksban.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272648419308849266" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br />Summit also mean socializing !  Many <span style="font-style: italic;">people, </span>many <span style="font-style: italic;">beer, </span>good <span style="font-style: italic;">food, </span>it can only lead to a nice reception :) I even hacked a bit with Sandro from the JCR management project which is really cool. How is that possible that all the guys working on models repositories are so friendly ?<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw2PTXwjmI/AAAAAAAAACQ/DYk8XxTYJ5A/s1600-h/hackingwithsandro_1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 214px;" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw2PTXwjmI/AAAAAAAAACQ/DYk8XxTYJ5A/s320/hackingwithsandro_1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272648900269870690" border="0" /></a>I also chatted a bit with the whole Eclipse marketing effort !<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw2yrwAD-I/AAAAAAAAACY/Dd67YTO-kxc/s1600-h/eclipsemarketing_1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 214px; height: 320px;" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw2yrwAD-I/AAAAAAAAACY/Dd67YTO-kxc/s320/eclipsemarketing_1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272649508109422562" border="0" /></a><br />Then many more talks, chats, with many other Eclipse project :) Time gets away too fast, and we were already having a last <span style="font-weight: bold;">modeling beer</span> at the Nestor hotel !<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw38TyMD3I/AAAAAAAAACg/lb5W3OpYo5U/s1600-h/lastmodelingbeer.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 152px;" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw38TyMD3I/AAAAAAAAACg/lb5W3OpYo5U/s400/lastmodelingbeer.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272650772986466162" border="0" /></a>See you at EclipseCon !<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw4UXRKL4I/AAAAAAAAACo/fotIk7FwEOA/s1600-h/lastbeer_1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 267px;" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_u5tMWln_Ie8/SSw4UXRKL4I/AAAAAAAAACo/fotIk7FwEOA/s400/lastbeer_1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272651186238533506" border="0" /></a>
