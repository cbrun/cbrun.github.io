We always intend to run our Eclipse projects as real open-source projects. Being open, transparent and so on. The
Eclipse Development process forces you to do so in some way, the simultaneous release brings a bit more constraints in
this regards but in the end, if you want a truly open project <b>you'll need to do more.</b><br /><br />Let's take EMF
Compare. It quickly jumped into the release train, adopted the Eclipse practices, got used by other components and had a
<a href="https://www.eclipse.dev/projects/ip_log.php?projectid=modeling.emf.compare">number of major
	contribution.</a><br /><br />We have two main groups of adopters: the first group is comprised of end-users, which
mostly have the perception the problem itself of comparing models is quite easy and it should "just works". They tend to
report bugs, UI glitches, and sometime even with patches. The second group is researchers, they know the problem is <a
	href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=399361#c3">not that easy</a> and having this component enables
all kind of experiments on top of models for them. They tend to use compare in contexts we never ever
envisionned.<br /><br />We had several fairly big contributions from the second group (research) among the years and
have always been keen in integrating them, getting them on board in the team and in the release process. But the
contributors tend to fade away when their research subject change or when they leave the academic world. &nbsp;The
problem with "big" contributions is &nbsp;: we can't really maintain those over time with just the core
team.<br /><br />We also participated in several google summer of code programs, but so far never really managed to
transform students into day to day commiters.<br /><br />Driven by the first group of user, we rewrote many of the core
code of &nbsp;Compare last year, and now is a good time to get more people aboard.<br /><br />We acknowledged that
conferences, bugzilla, release reviews, and blog post were not enough, and we started a bunch of actions :<br /><br />
<h3>Being visible</h3>
<div>Includes posting notes on the interweb about progress, new use cases. Giving talks in tech or academic conferences,
	and having a comprehensive documentation.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>With the 2.x stream, we had to go over all of our documentation anyway, the <a
		href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/EMF_Compare/User_Guide">User Guide</a> is now in a better shape.</div><br />
<h3>A build system you can launch@home</h3>Building &nbsp;Compare is just a matter of &nbsp;<span
	style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;"><b>mvn clean package</b></span><br />you
can point to a specific target platform (we tend to keep the widest compatibility possible) with<br /><br /><span
	style="background-color: white; font-size: x-small;"><span
		style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">mvn clean package </span><b
		style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">-Pjuno</b></span><br /><span
	style="background-color: black; color: white; font-size: x-small;"><b
		style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></b></span>or<br /><span
	style="background-color: white; font-size: x-small;"><span
		style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">mvn clean package </span><b
		style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">-Pkepler</b></span><br /><br />launching the tests is
just as easy :<br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span
		style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">mvn clean
			<b>verify</b>&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><span
			style="font-size: x-small;">-Pkepler</span></span></span><br /><br />As you would expect, &nbsp;the builds
are run on the<a href="https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/emf-compare-master/"> eclipse public
	server.</a><br /><br />The only part of the build which depends on the eclipse infrastructure is the signing and
promote process, but those are kept in particular profiles.<br /><br />
<h3>Contributor 101</h3>We describe our expectation regarding contribution in the <a
	href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/EMF_Compare/Contributor_Guide">Contributor Guide</a>. Our requirements regarding
<b>checkstyle, API tooling, specifications documents</b> are described there.<br /><br />Setting our expectation can be
seen as a new barrier to contribution, but on the other hand our expectations have always been that way and not
describing it lead to a misunderstandings : your contribution is valuable, makes no mistake, but most of the time there
is way more to do than just dropping a line of code in the bugzilla.<br /><br /><b>Gerrit</b> looked like a good way to
ramp up, a contributor can have feedback from the commiters, but also from the automated build launched on top of his
changes. &nbsp;This looks like a win win so we decided to migrate to gerrit and to<a
	href="https://hudson.eclipse.org/sandbox/job/emf-compare.gerrit/"> setup a build</a> which checks the tests on top
of the platforms we are currently supporting. The <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Gerrit">Eclipse wiki</a> is highly
valuable for this, and the webmasters have again demonstrated their support in this process.<br /><br />We'll see how it
goes over time, I'm not 100% buying gerrit itself which can be quite intimidating and I'm looking forward to the list of
cons <a href="https://milesparker.blogspot.fr/">Miles</a> will soon publish ;), but it feels right to have this public
and open staging area with constant feedback.<br /><br /><b>Documentation</b> also is a key ingredient here. Have a look
on the<a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/EMF_Compare/Developer_Guide"> Developer Guide</a>, I wouldn't say it's complete
because it's not, but you can at least start and have a rough understanding of how Compare works behind the
scene.<br /><br />We're not completely done here, we still have to list "<i>low hanging fruits</i>" - aka Junior Jobs or
tasks which can be tackled to discover Compare's internals.<br /><br />
<h3>Engage</h3><br />To engage developers - adopters which might turn into contributors and maybe at some point
commiters you have to at least support them. <a href="https://eclipsemde.blogspot.fr/">Laurent</a> is checking the
following channels besides the bugzilla : the Eclipse forums/newsgroup and stackoverflow. We always had a great example
of that in the EMF community through Ed's relentless effort on the newsgroups.<br /><br />But to take part in the
development of a project, you also need to know what's going on. We were missing a real channel for this : notifying
peoples when we drafted the work we are starting and engaging them in a potential discussion about these evolutions We
recently decided to use the emf-dev mailling list for that, you might have seen a <a
	href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/emf-dev/msg01551.html">few</a> <a
	href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/emf-dev/msg01553.html">examples</a> <a
	href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/emf-dev/msg01558.html">lately</a>, the golden rule being : <b>these
	mails are just a starting point for further discussions into a given bugzilla. </b>We won't turn the mailling-list
as a very chatty place, on the other hand with only a dozen of threads for one year which are not related to commiter
election or project meta-data I think there is room for more discussions.<br /><br />I can't say this triggered a lot of
reaction so far but I'd <b>love</b> to see other projects doing that on the emf mailling list.<br /><br />
<div>
	<h3>Predictability</h3>
</div>
<div>Always set expectations. We used to have a fairly thin project plan only describing themes, we now have a detailled
	one :</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><a href="https://www.eclipse.dev/projects/project-plan.php?projectid=modeling.emf.compare">EMF Compare 2.1 project
		plan.</a></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>One can see which bugzilla tickets we'll work on during which milestone of a given release.</div>
<div>In the process we cleaned up our bugzilla, closing pending tickets, often with a comment <i>"this is no longer true
		for 2.x, it just rocks"</i>.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Also set expectations on a given issue/bugzilla, we always tend to think : "your problem is a real one, we'll
	<b>have</b> to tackle it at some point", and let the thing open waiting for the moment we'll get back to it.
	Sometimes, this moment only come months or years after the original report. Being clear wether we'll &nbsp;work
	right away on something you reported is important, and stating the contrary is an occasion for an adopter to get
	onboard.</div>
<div><br />As a side note, there are times that we look at a bug, think that "this is a totally stupid mistake" ... but
	then simply forget about it (we're working on something else, we're not on the good branch to tackle it
	directly...). Do not hesitate to ping us if we do not answer to trivial bugs (such as <a
		href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=367527">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=367527</a>)
	in a timely manner.</div>
<div>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
</div>
<div>We already have a fairly good track records of openness with many contributions in the history of the project,
	we'll see if doing so much more efforts will have an impact and I'll sure get back to you then.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I can only assure you one thing : &nbsp;it takes a bit more time, it takes commitment, but it <b>feels good.</b>
