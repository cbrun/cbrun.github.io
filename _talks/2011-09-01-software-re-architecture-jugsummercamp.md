For teams modernizing legacy systems. We showed how modeling helps inventory architectures, reason about dependencies, and plan refactorings with less risk.

## Key Takeaways
- Visualization: make dependencies and hotspots explicit.
- Incrementalism: carve out seams, migrate in steps.
- Tooling: use models to keep plans executable and auditable.

## Context
