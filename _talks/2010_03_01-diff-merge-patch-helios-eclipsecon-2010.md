For engineers updating to the Helios release. We walked through model diff/merge with EMF Compare and how to create patches to share changes safely across teams.

- Use 3‑way merge to preserve intent and minimize conflicts.
- Share changes as patches when direct merges aren’t possible.

## Context
- Event: EclipseCon, San Francisco
