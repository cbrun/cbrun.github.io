For researchers and practitioners in the early days of MDE adoption. This talk shared lessons from applying model‑driven engineering in industry, why meta‑modeling matters, and how EMF/Ecore unlock consistent tooling across the lifecycle.

## Key Takeaways
- Foundations: meta‑models, constraints, and transformations as durable assets.
- Tooling: EMF/Ecore as a pragmatic baseline for building and exchanging models.
- Adoption: start small with clear ownership and validation; iterate toward automation.

## Context
- Event: IDM 2006, Lille
- Date: 2006
- Slides: {{ site.url }}/talks/IDM06/Obeo.pdf
