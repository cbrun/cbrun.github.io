excerpt: "Journal article on model differencing in EMF—foundations and implications for tooling."
draft: true
---

For researchers and tool builders who need robust model comparison. The article explains matching strategies, equivalences, and how structural differences drive meaningful merges in EMF.

## Key Takeaways
- Matching: identity vs. heuristic matching and their trade‑offs.
- Differences: add/remove/move/change at the model level—beyond text.
- Tooling: why good differencing is the backbone of collaborative modeling.

## Context
