For developers curious about code generation with modeling. A hands‑on path from meta‑model to templates to a running webapp (e.g., backbone.js), covering the build chain and testing strategy.

## Key Takeaways
- Flow: model → template → generated code → runtime.
- Quality: test templates; keep generated code cleanly separated.
- Scaling: regenerate safely as the meta‑model evolves.

## Context
- Event: BreizhCamp, Rennes
- Date: 2012
