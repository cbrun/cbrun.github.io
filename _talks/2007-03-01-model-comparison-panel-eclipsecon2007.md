For teams versioning models at scale. We discussed the unique challenges of structural diff/merge, why textual diffs fall short, and the techniques that make collaborative modeling sustainable.

## Key Takeaways
- Semantics first: compare abstract syntax trees, not files, to avoid noise.
- 3‑way merge: embrace proper base/left/right to resolve conflicts reliably.
- UX matters: good visualization and review flows make or break adoption.

## Context

- Date: 2007
