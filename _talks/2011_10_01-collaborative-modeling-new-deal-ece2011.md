---

For organizations coordinating modeling across teams and partners. We covered governance, versioning, and review practices that keep models usable and alive.

## Key Takeaways
- Versioning: treat models like code—branches, reviews, and CI.
- Shared semantics: stabilize meta‑models and validation early.
- Tooling: combine editors, compare/merge, and traceability for scale.

## Context
- Event: EclipseCon Europe, Ludwigsburg
- Date: 2011
- Program: https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2011/sessions/collaborative-modeling-new-deal.html
