excerpt: "Defining custom modeling environments with Eclipse technologies—patterns to keep them robust and evolvable."
draft: true
---

For tool builders defining domain‑specific environments. We walked through the steps to design a meta‑model, select editors (textual/graphical/forms), and assemble a coherent environment that can evolve safely over time.

## Key Takeaways
- Architecture: separate domain logic, view models, and generation.
- Choices: when to use Sirius, Xtext, or both as a hybrid.
- Evolution: versioning, migrations, and automated validation.
