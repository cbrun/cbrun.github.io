For teams building DSL tooling. A practical checklist for defining the meta‑model, selecting editors, and structuring the project so it evolves cleanly.

## Key Takeaways
- Start with the domain: clarify concepts and constraints first.
- Choose tools by need: textual vs. graphical vs. forms—often hybrid.
- Iterate: validate early with stakeholders; keep migration paths in mind.
