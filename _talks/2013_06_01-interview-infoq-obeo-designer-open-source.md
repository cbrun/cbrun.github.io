For Eclipse adopters, project leads, and contributors curious about what it means to take a successful commercial tool open source. We discuss why Obeo contributed Obeo Designer to the Eclipse Foundation as Sirius, how governance changes the game for users and partners, and what to expect when a codebase becomes a community project.

## Key Takeaways
- Governance: contribution under the Eclipse Foundation brings vendor‑neutral IP, open processes, and a stable place for collaboration.
- Impact: users gain transparency and longevity; contributors get a predictable path to influence the roadmap.
- Migration: how we bridged Obeo Designer to Sirius without breaking existing usage patterns.
