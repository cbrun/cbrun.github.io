draft: true
---

For MBSE practitioners, modeling tool builders, and researchers evaluating web‑based engineering tools. The session shows how Sirius Web enables rich diagramming on the web and how SysON brings open SysMLv2 editing to the Eclipse ecosystem, with an emphasis on collaboration, extensibility, and interoperability.

## Key Takeaways
- Sirius Web: full‑fidelity web modeling with diagrams, forms, tables, and collaboration.
- SysON: open‑source SysMLv2 tooling on Sirius Web with import/export for interoperability.
- Extensibility: customize and integrate to fit enterprise workflows and UX needs.
