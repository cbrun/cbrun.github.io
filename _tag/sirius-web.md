description: "I explore how to build serious modeling tools for the web. From Sirius Web and SysON to Papyrus-on-the-web experiments, you’ll find hands-on demos, UI/UX patterns (icons, diagrams, interactions), and architecture notes for running modelers in a browser, collaboratively and at scale. Most posts are pragmatic: what worked, what broke, and why. If you’re evaluating web-based modeling for MBSE or DSLs, start here."
