Ecore and EMF are the bedrock of many of our tools, so this hub collects the evergreen pieces: the Ecore reference card, design checklists, and articles on validation, queries (AQL), compare/merge, and diagram editors. If you create or evolve meta-models, you’ll find concise rules of thumb, annotated examples, and pointers to EMF/Sirius best practices that save time—and bugs.
