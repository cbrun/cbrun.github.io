tag: "MBSE"
description: "This section gathers my notes on Model-Based Systems Engineering with a focus on SysMLv2 and how web tooling changes team workflows. Expect takeaways from events, comparisons, and practical examples that move beyond slides: simulation, analysis, and collaboration scenarios running in the browser. Itâ€™s aimed at systems engineers and tool builders who want concrete, open-source ways to modernize MBSE."
